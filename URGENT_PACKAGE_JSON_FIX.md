# URGENT: Package.json Syntax Error Fix

## The Problem
There's a missing comma on line 12 causing the JSON parse error:

**Line 12 (BROKEN):**
```json
  }
  "dependencies": {
```

**Line 12 (FIXED):**
```json
  },
  "dependencies": {
```

## Quick Fix Steps
1. Open `package.json` in the editor
2. Go to line 12
3. Add a comma after the closing brace: `},`
4. Save the file

## Alternative: Use the Working Build Script
Since package.json editing is problematic, use this instead:

```bash
./build-mobile-complete.sh
```

This bypasses the package.json issue and builds your production server directly.

## Test After Fix
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

The missing comma is the only issue preventing your deployment from working.
