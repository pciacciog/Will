# Manual Git Conflict Resolution for WILL Project

## Current Situation
- You have 4 local commits ahead of origin/main
- Origin/main has 2 new commits you need to pull
- Conflicts exist in: `capacitor.config.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Git lock file is preventing automated operations

## Step-by-Step Resolution

### Method 1: Using Replit Git UI (Recommended)

1. **Open Replit's Git Panel**
   - Click the "Version Control" icon in the left sidebar
   - You should see the conflict status

2. **Resolve Conflicts**
   - The Git panel will show conflicted files
   - Click on each conflicted file to see the merge editor
   - Choose which version to keep for each conflict

3. **For capacitor.config.json:**
   - Keep the LOCAL version (your current file)
   - It contains the APNs push notification configuration
   - This is critical for the push notification functionality

4. **For package-lock.json:**
   - Delete the current file and regenerate it:
   ```bash
   rm package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
   - This resolves dependency conflicts automatically

5. **Commit the Resolution**
   - In the Git panel, stage all resolved files
   - Commit with message: "Resolve merge conflicts: maintain APNs integration"

6. **Push to GitHub**
   - Click "Push" in the Git panel

### Method 2: Using Shell (If Git UI Fails)

If you have shell access and Git permissions:

```bash
# 1. Remove lock file
rm -f .git/index.lock

# 2. Check status
git status

# 3. Keep your local capacitor.config.json (has APNs config)
git add capacitor.config.json

# 4. Regenerate package-lock.json
rm package-lock.json
npm install
git add package-lock.json

# 5. Commit resolution
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts: maintain APNs integration"

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Method 3: Alternative Approach

If conflicts persist:

1. **Create a backup of your important changes:**
   - Copy `server/pushNotificationService.ts`
   - Copy `AuthKey_4J2R866V2R_fixed.p8`
   - Copy any other APNs-related files

2. **Reset to remote:**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

3. **Re-apply your APNs changes:**
   - Restore the backed-up files
   - Commit with clear message about APNs integration

## Critical Files to Preserve

These contain your APNs integration work:
- `server/pushNotificationService.ts` - Real APNs functionality
- `AuthKey_4J2R866V2R_fixed.p8` - Fixed Apple key
- `capacitor.config.json` - Push notification config
- `FINAL_PUSH_NOTIFICATION_STATUS.md` - Documentation

## Verification After Resolution

1. Ensure server starts: `NODE_ENV=development npx tsx server/index-standalone.ts`
2. Check APNs logs show: "Real push notifications ENABLED"
3. Verify GitHub sync is complete
4. Test push notification endpoints

## Next Steps After Sync

1. Build iOS app: `npm run build && npx cap sync ios`
2. Deploy to TestFlight for real device testing
3. Test end-to-end push notification flow

The key is preserving your APNs integration work while resolving the dependency conflicts safely.
