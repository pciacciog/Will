# Push Notification Race Condition Fix - Verification Guide

## Issue Identified
The race condition was occurring because:
1. `PushNotifications.register()` was called first
2. Event listeners were attached afterward
3. If APNs returned the token quickly, the registration event fired before listeners were ready
4. Result: Silent failure, no device token captured

## Fix Applied
**NotificationService.ts now correctly orders operations:**

```javascript
// CORRECT ORDER (implemented):
console.log('Setting up push notification listeners...');

// 1. Attach ALL listeners first
PushNotifications.addListener('registration', async (token) => { ... });
PushNotifications.addListener('registrationError', (err) => { ... });
PushNotifications.addListener('pushNotificationReceived', (notification) => { ... });
PushNotifications.addListener('pushNotificationActionPerformed', (notification) => { ... });

console.log('All listeners set up. Now registering for push notifications...');

// 2. THEN call register()
await PushNotifications.register();
console.log('PushNotifications.register() called successfully');
```

## Build Steps for iOS
1. `npm run build` - Rebuild frontend with fix ✅
2. `npx cap copy ios` - Copy updated web assets to iOS ✅  
3. `npx cap sync ios` - Sync Capacitor configuration ✅
4. **Rebuild iOS app in Xcode with updated code**
5. **Install updated app on device**

## Expected Console Logs (After Fix)
When you test the updated app, you should see:

```
Push notification permissions granted
Setting up push notification listeners...
All listeners set up. Now registering for push notifications...
PushNotifications.register() called successfully
✅ Push registration success! Token received: [64-char token]
Token length: 64
Token type: string
Sending device token to backend...
✅ Device token successfully stored on server
```

## Verification
- **Before fix**: `register()` call logged, then `addListener()` calls
- **After fix**: Multiple `addListener()` calls logged, then `register()` call
- **Success**: Registration event fires and token is captured

The race condition fix is now in the codebase and ready for iOS build.
