UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS: Shared Will "Join Will" Flow

Hey! The Shared Will joining experience needs several updates to make it clearer that this is a SHARED commitment (not individual commitments). See attached screenshot for reference.

CONTEXT:
When a user creates a Shared Will, other circle members need to join it. The current UI is confusing because it's using language/formatting designed for Normal Wills (where everyone has their own commitment).

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. NOTIFICATION TEXT (Push Notification):
   Current: "New Will proposed" (generic)
   New: "[Name] proposed a new Shared Will" 
   - Make it clear it's a SHARED will
   - Include proposer's name

2. DETAILS PAGE - PROPOSER INFO SECTION:
   Current format (see screenshot):
   - Shows "First Name" "Last Name" 
   - "I will" 
   - "fast for 24 hours this week"
   - This format works for Normal Wills but is confusing for Shared Wills
   
   New format for Shared Wills:
   - "[Full Name] has proposed a shared commitment:"
   - "[commitment text]" (no "I will" or "We will" prefix)
   - Example: "Jack Delgues has proposed a shared commitment: Fast for 24 hours this week"
   - Make it crystal clear ONE person is proposing ONE commitment for EVERYONE

3. "TEAM COMMITMENT" SECTION (Purple box at top):
   Current:
   - Title: "Team Commitment"
   - Subtitle: "We Will Fast for 24 hours this week"
   
   Changes:
   - Title: Keep "Team Commitment" (or consider "Shared Commitment"?)
   - Subtitle: Remove "We Will" prefix → Just show "Fast for 24 hours this week"
   - Only show the commitment text itself

4. "LOADING... HAS PROPOSED" BUG:
   Current: "Loading... has proposed the following:"
   Fix: Show actual person's name who proposed the Will
   - This appears to be a loading state that's not resolving properly
   - Should show: "[Full Name] has proposed the following:"

5. MOVE "TEAM COMMITMENT" SECTION:
   Current: "Team Commitment" purple box is at the TOP of the screen
   New: Move this section to be INSIDE the "Will Schedule" card below
   - The Team Commitment should be part of the Will Details, not separate at top
   - Makes the information flow more logical

6. DELETE UNNECESSARY TEXT:
   Remove: "Join your circle for this commitment period and work together toward your goals"
   - This text is redundant and clutters the screen
   - The page is already clearly about joining a Will

7. "BECAUSE" SECTION (Why page - not shown in screenshot):
   Same rule: Remove "We Will" prefix
   - Just show the commitment text
   - Example: "Fast for 24 hours this week" not "We Will Fast for 24 hours this week"

OVERALL GOAL:
Make Shared Wills feel distinct from Normal Wills:
- Normal Will: "Each person defines their own commitment"
- Shared Will: "ONE person proposes ONE commitment for EVERYONE"

The UI should clearly communicate:
1. WHO proposed it (full name, not "Loading...")
2. WHAT they're proposing (commitment text only, no "We Will")
3. That it's a SHARED commitment everyone will do together

Please implement these changes and ensure the Shared Will joining flow is clear and intuitive!
