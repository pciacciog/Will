"The WillReviewFlow component needs to be adaptive for solo mode. Currently it has circle-specific language that doesn't make sense when working alone.

Component to Update:
File: client/src/components/WillReviewFlow.tsx
This is the 3-step review modal that appears when a Will ends (status = will_review).

Current Issues (Circle-Only Language):
Step 2 (Reflect):

Text: "Add a short note for your circle"
❌ Problem: In solo mode, there's no circle

Step 3 (Share):

Text: "Review before sharing with your circle"
Button: "Share with Circle"
❌ Problem: In solo mode, you're not sharing with anyone


Required Changes:
Detect Mode:
The component receives a will prop. Use will.mode to determine if it's solo or circle:
typescriptconst isSolo = will.mode === 'solo';
Step 2 (Reflect) - Update Text:
Current:
tsx<p>Add a short note for your circle</p>
Change to:
tsx<p>
  {isSolo 
    ? "Add a short note for yourself" 
    : "Add a short note for your circle"
  }
</p>
Step 3 (Share) - Rethink the Concept:
For Circle Mode (current):

Header: "Review before sharing with your circle"
Shows: Your acknowledgment + reflection
Button: "Share with Circle"
Concept: You're posting to the group

For Solo Mode (new approach):
The user suggests changing to "review before finalizing" or something similar. Here are some options - please choose what feels best UX-wise:
Option A: "Finalize Your Review"
tsx<h3>Finalize Your Review</h3>
<p>Review your reflection before completing this Will</p>
<Button>Complete Will</Button>
Option B: "Confirm & Submit"
tsx<h3>Confirm Your Reflection</h3>
<p>Review your progress and reflection</p>
<Button>Submit Review</Button>
Option C: "Save Your Reflection"
tsx<h3>Save Your Reflection</h3>
<p>Your reflection will be saved to your Will history</p>
<Button>Save & Complete</Button>
Your call: Which approach feels most natural for solo accountability? Or suggest something even better.

Suggested Implementation:
tsx// Step 3 content
{step === 3 && (
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">
        {isSolo 
          ? "Finalize Your Review" 
          : "Review Before Sharing"
        }
      </h3>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        {isSolo
          ? "Review your reflection before completing this Will"
          : "Review before sharing with your circle"
        }
      </p>
    </div>

    {/* Show the summary */}
    <Card className="bg-accent/50">
      <CardContent className="pt-4">
        <div className="space-y-3">
          <div>
            <p className="text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground">
              Follow Through
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold">
              {followThrough === 'yes' ? '✓ Completed' : '✗ Not Completed'}
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <p className="text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground">
              Your Reflection
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">{reflection}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>

    {/* Buttons */}
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <Button variant="outline" onClick={() => setStep(2)}>
        Edit
      </Button>
      <Button 
        onClick={handleSubmit}
        className="flex-1"
      >
        {isSolo ? "Submit Review" : "Share with Circle"}
      </Button>
    </div>
  </div>
)}

Additional Considerations:
The "shareWithCircle" toggle (if it exists):

For solo mode: This toggle doesn't make sense - remove it or hide it
For circle mode: Keep it as-is

After submission messaging:

Solo: "Review saved! Your Will is now complete."
Circle: "Shared with your circle! Waiting for others..."


Summary of Changes:

✅ Detect isSolo from will.mode
✅ Step 2: "Add a short note for yourself" (solo) vs "your circle" (circle)
✅ Step 3 header: "Finalize Your Review" (solo) vs "Review Before Sharing" (circle)
✅ Step 3 description: Appropriate context for each mode
✅ Button text: "Submit Review" (solo) vs "Share with Circle" (circle)
✅ Hide/remove any circle-specific toggles for solo mode
✅ Update success messaging appropriately

Please implement these changes and choose the Step 3 wording that feels most natural for solo mode. Feel free to suggest improvements to my suggestions - you have the full context of the component!"
