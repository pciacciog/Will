You’re working on the End Room scheduling screen (screenshot attached). We’ve decided that the End Room should feel optional, inviting, and gentle—not mandatory or rule-heavy. I’d like you to make the following updates to the copy, structure, and flow. You can adjust styling and spacing as you see fit so it fits our design system.

1. Keep the main title

Leave as: “Schedule Your End Room”

2. Update the subtitle under the title

Replace the current subtitle with:

“An opportunity for your circle to gather, reflect, share, and honor the effort.”

Tone: calm, optional, inviting.

3. Update the instructional line above the date/time input

Current text is too directive. Please change it to:

“Choose a time to set up a video call after your Will ends on [date].”

(Dynamic date should still populate.)

4. Update the rules/info box

Rename “END ROOM RULES:” to:

“How the End Room works”

Inside, replace the current bullets with these three:

It will open automatically at the time you choose

It runs for 30 minutes

Once your Will starts, the time can’t be changed

If you feel a softer visual treatment fits better (less “error-style red”), feel free to adjust colors or borders.

5. Add a “Skip” option

Because the End Room is optional, add a Skip action somewhere appropriate at the bottom of the page (e.g., near the Back button or near the primary CTA).

The Skip button should:

Let the user skip End Room scheduling

Allow them to continue to creating the Will without setting a time

Not feel visually dominant

6. Add a Skip Confirmation Prompt

When the user taps Skip, show a modal or confirmation prompt such as:

Title:

Are you sure you want to skip the End Room?

Body:

This is your circle’s opportunity to gather and reflect at the end of your Will.
You can still continue without setting one.

Buttons:

Cancel (secondary)

Skip End Room (primary)

This ensures the user understands it’s optional while still being encouraged to reflect.

Feel free to refine exact phrasing or visual layout as needed.

7. Button logic (primary CTA)

The main action button should change depending on whether a time is selected:

If no date/time is entered:
“Create Will”

If date/time is entered:
“Create Will & Schedule End Room”

This makes the flow more intuitive and transparent.

Deliverables

Updated JSX and styling for the End Room screen

Skip button + confirmation modal

Updated text and info box

Any logic changes needed to support conditional CTAs

Short explanation of your changes

This should help the entire page feel optional, calm, and user-friendly while preserving clarity and functionality.
