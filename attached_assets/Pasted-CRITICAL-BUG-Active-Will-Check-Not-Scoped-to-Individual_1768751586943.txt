CRITICAL BUG: Active Will Check Not Scoped to Individual Circles

Hey! I found a major bug with the multi-circle implementation. The active Will enforcement is not working correctly.

CURRENT BROKEN BEHAVIOR:
- I have 2 circles
- Circle A has an active Will (scheduled to start Jan 19)
- I go to Circle B (different circle, no active Will)
- I try to create a Will in Circle B
- I get 400 error: "Your circle already has an active will"
- This is WRONG - Circle B does NOT have an active Will

EXPECTED CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
- Each circle should be independent
- Rule: ONE active Will per circle maximum
- But you CAN have multiple active Wills as long as they're in DIFFERENT circles
- Circle A having an active Will should NOT prevent Circle B from having its own active Will

THE BUG:
The system is checking if the USER has any active Will (old single-circle logic), when it should be checking if THIS SPECIFIC CIRCLE has an active Will (new multi-circle logic).

DIAGNOSIS NEEDED:

1. WHERE IS THIS CHECK HAPPENING?
   - What API endpoint returns this error?
   - POST /api/wills/create ?
   - What file/function contains this validation?

2. CURRENT CODE (WRONG):
// Old single-circle logic - WRONG for multi-circle
const userActiveWill = await storage.getUserActiveWill(userId);
if (userActiveWill) {
return res.status(400).json({ message: "Your circle already has an active will" });
}

3. CORRECT CODE SHOULD BE:
// New multi-circle logic - check THIS circle only
const circleActiveWill = await storage.getCircleActiveWill(circleId);
if (circleActiveWill) {
return res.status(400).json({ message: "This circle already has an active will" });
}

QUESTIONS:

1. Can you locate the exact code that's checking for active Wills before creation?
2. Is it checking by userId (WRONG) or by circleId (CORRECT)?
3. Does the storage layer have a `getCircleActiveWill(circleId)` method?
4. If not, we need to create it

FIX REQUIRED:

1. Change the active Will check from user-scoped to circle-scoped
2. Each circle should independently allow one active Will
3. User should be able to have up to 3 active Wills simultaneously (one per circle, max 3 circles)

Please show me:
- The current validation code that's causing this error
- The proposed fix to scope it to circleId instead of userId
- Any other places where similar user-scoped checks need to be changed to circle-scoped

This is blocking me from using multiple circles properly - it's the whole point of the feature!
