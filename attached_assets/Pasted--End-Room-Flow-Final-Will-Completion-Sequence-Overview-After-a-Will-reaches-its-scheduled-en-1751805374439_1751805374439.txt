🧭 End Room Flow – Final Will Completion Sequence
🔁 Overview:
After a Will reaches its scheduled end time, the app should guide the user (and their Circle) through a three-step closure process:
1. Countdown to the End Room session
2. Live End Room (30 min breakout session)
3. Final Will Summary + Acknowledge

🔄 Flow Breakdown:
✅ 1. Will Ends → Status Changes to “Pending End Room”
* Once the Will’s scheduled end date & time is reached:
    * The Will status should automatically change from Active to Pending End Room.
    * A countdown timer (based on the pre-scheduled End Room time) should begin.
    * The End Room session must have been scheduled after the Will's end time, and no later than 48 hours after it ends.

🟢 2. End Room Becomes Live
* At the scheduled End Room time:
    * A video call link or embedded session should automatically activate.
    * The session remains live for exactly 30 minutes.
    * During this time, users can join, share reflections, and bond.
* During this session, the status should display something like: kotlin CopyEdit   “End Room in progress – this is your moment to reflect and celebrate.”
*   
* Once the 30 minutes are up:
    * Automatically close the room.
    * Update Will status to: Complete

📄 3. Final Summary View
* After the End Room ends:
    * Display a Final Will Summary window as a modal or new page.
    * This should include:
        * Will duration (start and end dates)
        * Each member’s Will item
        * Participation log (who joined the End Room, timestamp)
        * Any submitted reflections (if applicable)
* Acknowledge button at the bottom: css CopyEdit   [ Acknowledge and Close Will ]
*   
* Only after this button is clicked:
    * Clear Will from active state.
    * Return to the “Start a New Will” view.
    * Optionally archive the Will for viewing later in a “History” section.

🧠 Notes & Logic Checks:
* ⏳ The End Room must be scheduled in the initial Will setup and validated to:
    * Start after the Will ends
    * Start within 48 hours of Will end time
* 🧾 The final summary view is crucial for closure, so it should not be skippable.
