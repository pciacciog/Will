Text input → powerful but not simple

Wheels → slow, frustrating, outdated (your current pain)

One sentence UX rule for WILL

If the user knows the time, let them tap it once.

If you want, I can:

Propose exact times based on your app use cases (BJJ, wake-up, journaling)

Help you remove the modal entirely and keep it one screen

Give you a SwiftUI layout snippet (very clean)

This change alone will make the app feel faster and more confident.

help me delvep a rpmotp re plit plz so che can improve all thes instacnes where we have time pickers

Perfect — this is exactly the right moment to use Replit well 👍
Below is a copy-paste–ready prompt you can drop straight into Replit to guide a global, consistent refactor of all time pickers.

Replit Prompt (Use This As-Is)

Goal: Improve all time-selection interactions across the iOS app to be faster, simpler, and more modern by removing scroll-based time pickers wherever possible.

Context:
The current implementation relies heavily on default iOS wheel-style time pickers, which feel slow and friction-heavy. Users must scroll to select hours and minutes, which is frustrating for common, habitual actions.

Design Direction (Very Important):
Prioritize simplicity, speed, and decisiveness over flexibility.

New Standard Pattern:

Replace wheel-style time pickers with tap-based time chips wherever the time does not require minute-level precision.

Time chips should be presented as a grid of common times (e.g. 6:00 AM, 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 6:00 PM, 8:00 PM).

Selecting a time should require one tap only.

Include a single “Custom” option that opens the native time picker only if a non-standard time is required.

Behavior Rules:

Default to the last-used time when possible.

If no history exists, default to a sensible, context-based time.

Use 30-minute increments max (no 5–10 minute granularity unless strictly necessary).

Avoid modal interruptions when possible; prefer inline selection.

Scope of Changes:

Audit the entire codebase for time pickers (DatePicker with .hourAndMinute, wheel pickers, modal time selectors).

Refactor each instance to use the new Time Chip Selection Component unless the screen explicitly requires precise scheduling.

Ensure visual and behavioral consistency across all screens.

Implementation Notes (SwiftUI):

Create a reusable TimeChipPicker component.

Accept parameters for:

Available time options

Selected time binding

Optional fallback to native picker

Keep the UI clean, minimal, and fast.

Success Criteria:

Users can select a time in one tap for the majority of flows.

Scrolling is eliminated in common cases.

The app feels faster, more intentional, and less “form-like.”
