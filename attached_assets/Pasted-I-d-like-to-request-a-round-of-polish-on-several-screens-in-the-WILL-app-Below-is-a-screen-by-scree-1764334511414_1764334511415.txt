I’d like to request a round of polish on several screens in the WILL app. Below is a screen-by-screen list of UI and copy updates. Please feel free to adjust exact spacing/styling as long as the intent is preserved and everything stays consistent with the existing design system.

1. Set Your Timeline Screen
A. “Defaults to next Mon–Sun” note
* Use an asterisk-style note so it reads like a small disclaimer:
    * Add a small * to the relevant label(s) (e.g., “Start*” / “End*” or just “Start*”).
    * Under the Start/End date fields, in a smaller muted font, show: * Defaults to next Mon–Sun
* This should look subtle and clean, not loud.
B. Time picker ease-of-use
* The Start/End time picker feels too manual. Please make time selection smoother and less tedious, e.g.:
    * Use reasonable increments (15–30 minutes) instead of very granular scrolling, and/or
    * Otherwise simplify the interaction so selecting a time requires less manual effort.
* Use your judgment on the exact implementation; the main goal is that choosing a time feels quick and intuitive.

2. “Why Would You Like to Do This?” Screen
A. “I will …” summary card
    * Add a subtle border and/or light background tint
B. “Your Why” grouping
* Combine the label and privacy note into a single line above the input field, for example: Your Why (Private — only you can see this)
* Place this directly above the “Because …” field so the section feels like one unit.
C. Placeholder text alignment
* The placeholder text in the “Because” field (e.g. “I like how I feel after I talk to her”) is vertically misaligned (too high in the box).
* Please adjust the input styling so the placeholder is vertically centered:
    * Balance top/bottom padding
    * Ensure the line-height works with the input height
    * Avoid fixed heights that cause the text to hug the top.

3. Schedule Your End Room Screen
A. Skip button
* Move the Skip button further into the top-right corner of the End Room card area so it feels anchored.
* Slightly reduce its size and make sure it clearly looks like a tappable button (e.g., text-button or ghost/pill button), not just floating text.
B. Copy updates in the info box
* Increase the font size in the rules/info box slightly for readability.
* Update the bullets to:
    * “Virtual meeting link opens automatically at the time you choose.”
    * “Runs for 30 minutes.”
    * “Can’t be changed once your Will starts.”
* (Note the spaces in “once your Will starts.” It is currently reading as “oncewillstarts” with no space as a single word)
C. Create Will button
* The Create Will button looks too wide relative to its text. Please tighten the padding so the button feels more proportional to the text.
D. Video call line with end date/time
* Update the main instruction line to include the user’s selected end date/time, with distinct formatting. For example: “Choose a time for a video call after your Will ends on Dec 7, 2025 at 12:00 PM.” (The date/time can be italic, bold, or otherwise visually differentiated.)
E. Vertical compactness
* As you adjust, please try to preserve the layout as compact as reasonably possible so most of the content fits within one iPhone screen without unnecessary scrolling

4. Step 2: Expand Screen
A. Spacing / layout
* The top of this section feels overly padded. Please:
    * Reduce the vertical space between the Circle Commitments card and the Step 2 (purple) container.
    * Reduce the gap between the stepper (1–2–3) and the white Step 2 card.
    * Reduce the top padding inside the white card above “Step 2: Expand” so the title sits a bit higher, similar to the other steps.
B. Skip button
* Keep the Skip button in the upper-right of the white card, but:
    * Ensure it doesn’t collide visually with the title
    * Style it clearly as a button (text/ghost) with appropriate padding and tap target
    * Match its vertical alignment with the tightened top padding.
C. Text field behavior (typing experience)
* The note input currently feels like a large static box with a lot of empty space.
* Please make it behave more like a modern messaging input:
    * Start as a compact 1-line height
    * Auto-grow vertically as the user types (line by line)
    * After a reasonable max height (e.g., ~4–5 lines), stop growing and let the content scroll inside
    * Use modest, balanced vertical padding so the text doesn’t float in a huge box.

5. Step 3: Share Screen
A. Label copy
* Update the label text to: “Followed-Through?” (Capital T, with the hyphen and question mark.)
B. Status pill consistency (“Yes / Mostly / No”)
* The status pill should always display its text on a single line.
* Right now “Mostly” can wrap, while “No” and “Yes” do not.
* Please:
    * Prevent wrapping (e.g., white-space: nowrap)
    * Ensure pill width / padding is sufficient so “Mostly” doesn’t break onto two lines
    * Keep row height consistent regardless of which option is shown.
C. Row alignment & spacing
* Ensure the “Followed-Through?” label and its pill are vertically centered within their row.
* Keep the spacing between the “Followed-Through?” row and the “Notes” row consistent with our standard vertical rhythm (no extra gaps).
* Confirm that “Notes” and its grey placeholder (“No additional note added.”) feel visually grouped in a clean, readable card/container, as currently designed.

If you see a cleaner way to achieve any of this while staying aligned with the app’s overall style, feel free to propose it. Please share updated JSX/styling and any notes on how you implemented the layout and behavior changes.
