"Before the user tests the Will Review feature again with a fresh Will, I need you to document exactly what was implemented so we're all aligned.
Part 1: Code Changes Made
Please provide a complete list of what you changed to implement the Will Review feature:
Database Changes:
* What tables were added? (schemas, columns)
* What new enum values were added to will_status?
* List all migration files created
Backend Changes:
* scheduler.ts: What changed in the state transition logic?
    * Show the exact lines where Wills transition from active → will_review
    * Show the logic for will_review → completed (the two-condition check)
* API routes: What new endpoints were created?
    * Full list with their purpose
* State machine: Document the complete Will lifecycle now
Frontend Changes:
* What new components were created?
* What pages were modified?
* Where does the Will Review UI appear and under what conditions?

Part 2: Expected Behavior - Complete Will Flow
Walk me through what a user should experience from Will creation to completion:
1. Will Creation
* Step 1: When
* Step 2: What
* Step 3: Why
* Step 4: End Room (what happens here?)
2. Will States & Transitions Document each state and what triggers the transition:
* pending → when/how → next state?
* scheduled → when/how → next state?
* active → when/how → next state?
* will_review → when/how → next state?
* completed → when/how → next state?
* archived → when/how → next state?
3. The Will Review Process (Step-by-step user experience)
* When does a Will enter will_review state? (specific trigger)
* What does the user see on the Home screen?
* What happens when they click "Review"?
* Walk through all 3 steps of the review form
* What happens after they submit?
* What do they see if End Room is scheduled vs not scheduled?

5. Timeline Example Use this scenario to show expected behavior at each timestamp:
* Will ends: Nov 24 at 2:00 PM
* End Room scheduled: Nov 24 at 5:00 PM (5:00-5:30 PM)
* User A opens app: 2:15 PM
* User A submits review: 2:20 PM
* User B opens app: 3:00 PM
* User B submits review: 3:05 PM
* All reviews complete: 3:05 PM
* User A opens app again: 4:00 PM
* End Room time arrives: 5:00 PM
* End Room finishes: 5:30 PM
* User A opens app: 6:00 PM
At each timestamp, what status is the Will in? What does each user see?
