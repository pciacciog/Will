Remove "How Will You Track?" Page + Two-Track Accountability System

REMOVE THIS PAGE ENTIRELY
Delete the "How Will You Track?" page that asks users to choose between:
* Daily Check-ins
* One-time Check-in
Why remove it: The tracking method is now automatically determined by timeline choice (Ongoing vs Set Dates). Users don't need to make this decision.

TWO-TRACK ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM
Replace the removed page with automatic logic based on timeline:
ONGOING WILLS = Data-Driven 📊 (same flow as daily checks in have)
* Daily check-ins stored in database
* Show calendar view (same as how the daily check in wills currently have)
* User sees progress during Will
* Final review: auto-calculated from data + optional reflection
Why: Long-term habits need visible progress

SET DATES WILLS = Reflection-Based 🎯
* Daily check-ins acknowledged but NOT stored
* No calendar, no percentages, no tracking
* Final review modal only,: 
Why: Time-boxed challenges just need daily reminders, not data

UPDATED WILL CREATION FLOW

OLD FLOW:

What → Why → When (Timeline) → How Will You Track? → Create

NEW FLOW:

What → Why → When (Timeline with settings) → Create
The timeline page now includes check-in settings directly.

CHANGE 1: Ongoing Timeline Setup
Current: Only shows start date/time
Add these sections:

📅 START
[Date picker] [Time picker]

📆 ACTIVE DAYS
Which days does this apply to?
○ Every day (7 days/week)
○ Weekdays only (Mon-Fri)
○ Custom schedule
  [If custom: show day checkboxes]

⏰ CHECK-IN TIME
When should we ask if you did it?
[Time picker: 8:00 PM]
Store: activeDays, customDays, checkInTime

CHANGE 2: Set Dates Timeline Setup
Current: Shows start/end date/time
Add this section:

⏰ CHECK-IN TIME
When should we ask if you did it?
[Time picker: 8:00 PM]
💡 Pick a time after you've completed your Will
Store: checkInTime

BACKEND LOGIC
For Ongoing Wills:
* Store every check-in in database
* Build calendar, calculate success rate
* Final review shows auto-calculated results
For Set Dates Wills:
* Acknowledge check-in with simple confirmation
* Do NOT store in database
* No progress metrics
* Final review requires manual selection
Notifications:
* Send at user's check-in time
* Ongoing: Only on active days
* Set Dates: Every day until end date

WHAT TO BUILD
Remove:
* 		 Delete "How Will You Track?" page entirely
* 		 Remove tracking type selection UI
* 		 Remove one-time check-in flow
Add to Ongoing Setup:
* 		 Active Days section (Every day/Weekdays/Custom)
* 		 Check-In Time section
* 		 Store new fields in database
Add to Set Dates Setup:
* 		 Check-In Time section
Backend:
* 		 Only store check-ins for Ongoing Wills
* 		 Set Dates: acknowledge only, don't store
* 		 Auto-determine tracking from timeline type

Summary: No more "How Will You Track?" page. Timeline choice (Ongoing vs Set Dates) automatically determines if we track data or just prompt. Both timelines now capture check-in time directly in their setup.**
