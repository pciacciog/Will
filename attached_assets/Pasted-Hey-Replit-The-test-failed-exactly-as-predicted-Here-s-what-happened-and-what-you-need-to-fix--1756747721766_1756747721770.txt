Hey Replit,
The test failed exactly as predicted. Here's what happened and what you need to fix:
🚨 What Actually Happened During the Test:

✅ iOS app rebuilt → New device token generated and stored as pending-tokens
❌ Randy logged in → Device token stayed with pending-tokens (NOT transferred to Randy)
❌ Notification test → System couldn't find Randy's device token, fell back to stale token → 403 error

🔍 Root Cause: Missing Client-Side Code
Your server-side logic expects the device token to be sent with the login request, but your client-side login code doesn't actually send it.
🛠️ Critical Fix Needed:
You need to modify your client-side login code to include the device token in the login request.
Fix 1: Update Your Login Function
Find your login function (likely in NotificationService.ts, AuthService.ts, or wherever login happens) and modify it to:
javascript// Your current login probably looks like:
async function loginUser(email, password) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
  });
}

// UPDATE IT TO:
async function loginUser(email, password) {
  // Get the device token from localStorage
  const deviceToken = localStorage.getItem('deviceToken');
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ 
      email, 
      password,
      deviceToken: deviceToken  // ← ADD THIS LINE
    })
  });
}
Fix 2: Verify Server-Side Token Transfer
Make sure your /api/login endpoint actually processes the deviceToken field:
javascriptapp.post('/api/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password, deviceToken } = req.body;  // ← Extract deviceToken
  
  const user = await authenticateUser(email, password);
  
  if (user && deviceToken) {
    // Transfer token ownership
    await db.query(`
      UPDATE device_tokens 
      SET user_id = ?, registration_source = 'login_transfer'
      WHERE device_token = ?
    `, [user.id, deviceToken]);
    
    console.log(`🔄 Token transferred to user ${user.id}`);
  }
  
  res.json({ success: true, user });
});
🧪 Test Again:
After making these fixes:

Rebuild iOS app (new token)
Login as Randy → Should see logs: "Token transferred to user [RANDY_ID]"
Test notification → Should work without 403 errors

💡 The Issue:
Your server-side association logic was correct, but you never implemented the client-side code to actually send the device token during login. The token stayed "pending" because the login request didn't include it.
Can you show us your current login function and update it to include the device token?
