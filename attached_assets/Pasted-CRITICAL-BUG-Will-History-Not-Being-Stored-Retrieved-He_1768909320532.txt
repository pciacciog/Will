CRITICAL BUG: Will History Not Being Stored/Retrieved

Hey! I found a major issue with Will history. Completed Wills are not showing up in history - users just see "No history available" even though they've completed Wills.

THE PROBLEM:

- Users complete Wills (go through the entire cycle)
- They click "View History" 
- Expected: See list of past completed Wills
- Actual: "No history available"
- The Wills are disappearing instead of being archived

EXAMPLES:
- Circle ERHCVX (Bebo and Jack) just completed a Will
- When they click "View History", it shows no history
- But they JUST finished a Will - it should be there

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:

1. DATABASE CHECK:
   - Query the database for circle ERHCVX
   - Show me ALL Wills in this circle (any status)
   - Are there any Wills with status "completed" or "archived"?
   - What statuses exist in the Wills table for this circle?

2. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER COMPLETION:
   - When a Will reaches "completed" state, what's supposed to happen?
   - Does the status change to "archived"?
   - Or does it stay as "completed"?
   - Or is the Will being deleted?

3. HISTORY QUERY:
   - What query is being run when user clicks "View History"?
   - What statuses is it looking for? ("archived"? "completed"?)
   - Is it filtering by the correct circleId?
   - Show me the exact code/query

4. ACKNOWLEDGMENT IMPACT:
   - Does acknowledgment affect archival?
   - Are Wills supposed to be archived after all members acknowledge?
   - Or should they be visible even before acknowledgment?

5. STATUS LIFECYCLE:
   - What's the complete status progression for a Will?
   - pending → scheduled → active → waiting_for_end_room → completed → ???
   - What's the final state?
   - When does it become visible in history?

6. DATA RETENTION:
   - Are completed Wills being deleted?
   - Is there any cleanup/garbage collection running?
   - Any automatic deletion of old Wills?

POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES:

A. Wills are staying in "completed" status, but history only looks for "archived"
B. Wills are being deleted instead of archived
C. History query is filtering by wrong status
D. History query is missing circleId filter (pulling from all circles)
E. Acknowledgment requirement blocking archival
F. Database constraint preventing status change to archived
G. Frontend showing wrong message when Wills exist but query fails

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

1. Show me raw database data:
   - All Wills in circle ERHCVX (any status)
   - Especially the Will that just completed
   - Its current status
   - Its timestamps

2. Show me the history query code:
   - What endpoint is called?
   - What SQL/query is executed?
   - What statuses does it filter for?
   - How does it filter by circle?

3. Show me the completion logic:
   - What happens when a Will ends?
   - What happens after End Room closes?
   - What happens after acknowledgment?
   - When/how does status change to archived?

4. Check for deletion logic:
   - Is there any code that deletes completed Wills?
   - Any scheduled cleanup jobs?
   - Any constraints that cascade delete?

5. Test manually:
   - Can you manually query for completed Wills in circle ERHCVX?
   - If they exist, why isn't the history showing them?
   - If they don't exist, where did they go?

This is critical - users need to see their past Wills for reflection and continuity! Without history, the app loses significant value.

Please investigate immediately and show me what you find!
