TL;DR: Apple rejected v1.0 (Submission ID: 478e9620-84c3-40cc-852e-4a897bfca977) for Guideline 2.3.8 – Accurate Metadata because our app icons are placeholders. Please replace all icons in the asset catalog with a finalized, consistent design and resubmit a new build.

What to do

Replace the App Icon set

Update the asset catalog at:

Swift/iOS native: ios/<AppName>/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/

React Native: ios/<AppName>/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/

Flutter: ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/

Provide one finalized design (no placeholders, no text like “AppIcon”, no default template).

Generate every required size, including:

App Store (Marketing): 1024×1024 PNG (no alpha)

iPhone: 180×180 (@3x), 120×120 (@2x)

iPad: 167×167, 152×152, 76×76

Spotlight/Settings: 80×80, 58×58, 40×40, 29×29 (and their @2x/@3x variants)

Ensure all sizes are the same artwork scaled—no color/style mismatches.

Verify Contents.json matches the files (no missing or extra entries).

Design/format constraints

PNG, no transparency (alpha disabled) for the 1024×1024 “Marketing Icon”.

Square artwork; iOS applies the rounded mask automatically—don’t pre-round.

No borders too close to the edge; keep safe margins so the mask doesn’t clip.

Clean up overrides

In Info.plist, ensure no custom CFBundleIcons/CFBundleAlternateIcons are pointing to old names.

Remove any legacy icon files in the project that aren’t referenced by the asset catalog.

Build & upload

Bump Build number (e.g., from 1 → 2).

Clean build folder, archive, and upload via Xcode (or Transporter).

In App Store Connect → the new build, confirm the 1024×1024 Marketing Icon is present.

Add a short note in Resolution Center: “Replaced placeholder icons with finalized, consistent artwork across all sizes per 2.3.8.”

Acceptance checklist (please confirm back)

 All icon slots in AppIcon.appiconset are filled with the same final design.

 Contents.json aligns with the actual filenames and scales.

 1024×1024 Marketing Icon exists, PNG, no alpha, correct branding.

 No alternate/legacy icon overrides in Info.plist.

 New build uploaded and attached to the 1.0 submission; note added in Resolution Center.

If you’d like me to supply a ready-to-drop icon set (all sizes + Contents.json) from a single 1024×1024 master, tell me the final artwork and I’ll generate the full AppIcon.appiconset for you.
