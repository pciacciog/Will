Issue Description
The deployment logs that previously displayed automatically in the Replit console are no longer visible. This is impacting our ability to debug and monitor the application.
What Changed
Previously: Deployment logs would automatically appear in the console, showing:

Server startup messages
API request logs
Error messages
Database operations
Push notification service logs

Currently: No deployment logs are visible, making it difficult to:

Debug issues
Monitor API calls
Track device token registration
See notification sending attempts

Diagnostic Questions
1. Console/Terminal Status

Is the Replit console/terminal still functioning?
Are there any error messages in the console itself?
Can you run manual commands in the terminal?

2. Application Status

Is the application still running and accessible?
Are API endpoints responding?
Is the database connection working?

3. Logging Configuration

Have any logging configurations changed?
Are console.log statements still in the code?
Has the logging level been modified?

4. Replit Environment

Have there been any Replit platform updates?
Are there any Replit-specific settings that might affect log visibility?
Is this affecting the main console, or just deployment logs?

5. Process Management

Is the Node.js process running correctly?
Are there multiple processes that might be interfering?
Has the startup command changed?

Immediate Troubleshooting Steps
Please try these and report results:
Step 1: Check Console Visibility
bash# In Replit terminal, try:
echo "Test message - can you see this?"
Step 2: Check Application Process
bash# Check if your app is running:
ps aux | grep node
Step 3: Manual Log Check
bash# Try to see recent logs:
pm2 logs
# or
npm run dev
Step 4: Force Log Output
Add a test log statement to your main server file:
javascriptconsole.log("üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Server is running at", new Date().toISOString());
setInterval(() => {
    console.log("üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Heartbeat", new Date().toISOString());
}, 10000);
Step 5: Check Replit Console Settings

Look for any console/terminal settings that might have changed
Check if there's a "show logs" or "show output" toggle
Verify the console is set to the correct output stream

Expected Response
Please provide:

Current console status - What do you see in the Replit interface?
Manual command results - Output from the troubleshooting steps above
Application accessibility - Can you still access your app at the deployment URL?
Any error messages - Screenshots or text of any errors you see
Recent changes - Any code changes or Replit settings modifications

Possible Causes
Based on common issues:

Replit console settings changed
Application crashed and restarted without proper logging
Node.js process redirection changed
Replit platform update affecting log display
Console output being redirected or suppressed

This diagnostic information will help identify whether it's a Replit platform issue, application configuration problem, or console display setting.
