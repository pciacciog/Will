You've identified a critical production issue. Yes, this will definitely be a problem for new users - every app install/reinstall generates a new device token that needs to be captured and linked to the user account.
Here's a comprehensive prompt for Replit AI to build a robust device token management system:

PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI AGENT:
CRITICAL: Implement Automatic Device Token Registration System
Currently, device tokens are generated but not automatically saved to the database, requiring manual intervention. This breaks push notifications for all new users and app reinstalls.
Required Implementation:
1. API Endpoint for Token Registration
Create POST /api/device-token that:

Accepts: { deviceToken: string, userId: string }
Validates user is authenticated
Stores/updates token in database linked to user
Handles duplicate tokens (update existing record)
Returns success/error response

2. Database Schema Enhancement
Ensure device tokens table has:

userId (foreign key to users)
deviceToken (unique string)
environment (SANDBOX/PRODUCTION - detect correctly)
platform (iOS/Android for future)
isActive (boolean for cleanup)
createdAt/updatedAt timestamps

3. Client-Side Integration
The iOS app logs show token registration:
ðŸŸ¢ Device Token Successfully Registered: 51db5eba...
But this token never reaches the database. You need to:

Hook into the iOS token registration success
Automatically call the new API endpoint
Handle registration failures gracefully

4. Token Lifecycle Management

New User Signup: Capture token during onboarding flow
Existing User Login: Update/refresh token on each login
App Reinstall: Handle token changes automatically
Token Cleanup: Mark old tokens as inactive when new ones are registered

5. Error Handling & Retry Logic

Network failures during token registration
Offline token registration with retry queue
Invalid/expired token cleanup
Duplicate token handling across users

Implementation Priority:

Create the API endpoint first
Wire up automatic calling from iOS app
Add token lifecycle management
Implement cleanup and error handling

Current Flow (BROKEN):
iOS App â†’ Generate Token â†’ Log Token â†’ [MISSING: Save to Database] â†’ Push Fails
Required Flow (FIXED):
iOS App â†’ Generate Token â†’ Call API â†’ Save to Database â†’ Push Works
Testing Requirements:
After implementation, test these scenarios:

New user signup and immediate notification
Existing user login and notification
App delete/reinstall and notification
Multiple devices per user

The goal is zero manual intervention for device token management in production.

This should create a production-ready system that automatically handles all device token scenarios.
