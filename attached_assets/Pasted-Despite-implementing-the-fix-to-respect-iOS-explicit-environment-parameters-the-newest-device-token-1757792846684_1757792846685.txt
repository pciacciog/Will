Despite implementing the fix to respect iOS explicit environment parameters, the newest device token is still being incorrectly classified:
Evidence from latest database state:

New token: 0b26... (newest token after environment fix)
Expected: is_sandbox: true (since iOS sends "environment": "sandbox")
Actual: is_sandbox: false (still being marked as production)
Missing data: bundle_id: null, build_scheme: null, provisioning_profile: null

Server logs show "BadDeviceToken" error:
üîç APNs Reason: BadDeviceToken
üîç HTTP Status: 400
üîç Response Headers: {"reason": "BadDeviceToken"}
This confirms the server is still trying to send sandbox tokens through production APNS endpoints.

üîç DIAGNOSIS NEEDED
The environment fix isn't working. We need to diagnose why:
Question 1: Is the iOS parameter being received?
Add logging to show exactly what the server receives:
javascriptapp.post('/api/device-token', async (req, res) => {
    console.log('üîç [DEBUG] Raw request body received:');
    console.log('üîç [DEBUG] environment parameter:', req.body.environment);
    console.log('üîç [DEBUG] Full body keys:', Object.keys(req.body));
    
    // Your environment detection logic...
});
Question 2: Is the environment logic actually executing?
The fix should show these logs when iOS sends sandbox tokens:
‚úÖ [DeviceToken] iOS app explicitly requested SANDBOX environment
Are you seeing this log message? If not, the logic isn't executing.
Question 3: Is there a different code path?
Check if there's another registration endpoint or code path being used that bypasses the environment fix.
Question 4: Missing bundle ID/provisioning data
The iOS app should be sending bundle ID and provisioning profile data:
swiftlet payload: [String: Any] = [
    "token": token,
    "environment": "sandbox",
    "bundleId": Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? "",
    // Add this debug logging in iOS:
    "debugInfo": [
        "bundleId": Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? "missing",
        "buildConfiguration": "Debug", // or detect dynamically
    ]
]

üß™ IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC STEPS
Step 1: Add Comprehensive Request Logging
javascriptapp.post('/api/device-token', async (req, res) => {
    console.log('üîç [DIAGNOSTIC] === NEW TOKEN REGISTRATION REQUEST ===');
    console.log('üîç [DIAGNOSTIC] Timestamp:', new Date().toISOString());
    console.log('üîç [DIAGNOSTIC] Full request body:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
    console.log('üîç [DIAGNOSTIC] Environment parameter:', req.body.environment);
    console.log('üîç [DIAGNOSTIC] Token hash:', req.body.deviceToken?.substring(0, 10) + '...');
    
    // Environment detection logic with detailed logging
    let environment;
    if (req.body.environment === 'sandbox') {
        environment = 'SANDBOX';
        console.log('‚úÖ [DIAGNOSTIC] iOS explicitly requested SANDBOX - should set is_sandbox: true');
    } else if (req.body.environment === 'production') {
        environment = 'PRODUCTION';
        console.log('‚úÖ [DIAGNOSTIC] iOS explicitly requested PRODUCTION - should set is_sandbox: false');
    } else {
        environment = detectTokenEnvironment(req.headers, 'ios');
        console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è [DIAGNOSTIC] No explicit environment, falling back to header detection:', environment);
    }
    
    const isSandbox = (environment === 'SANDBOX');
    console.log('üîç [DIAGNOSTIC] Final environment decision:');
    console.log('  - Environment string:', environment);
    console.log('  - is_sandbox value:', isSandbox);
    console.log('  - Will be stored as:', isSandbox ? 'SANDBOX' : 'PRODUCTION');
    
    // Continue with registration...
});
Step 2: Verify Database Insert
Add logging to confirm what actually gets stored:
javascript// After database insert
console.log('‚úÖ [DIAGNOSTIC] Token stored in database with:');
console.log('  - is_sandbox:', isSandbox);
console.log('  - bundle_id:', req.body.bundleId || 'null');
console.log('  - environment should be:', isSandbox ? 'SANDBOX' : 'PRODUCTION');

üéØ EXPECTED DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
If the fix is working correctly, you should see:
üîç [DIAGNOSTIC] Environment parameter: sandbox
‚úÖ [DIAGNOSTIC] iOS explicitly requested SANDBOX - should set is_sandbox: true
üîç [DIAGNOSTIC] Final environment decision: SANDBOX, is_sandbox: true
‚úÖ [DIAGNOSTIC] Token stored in database with is_sandbox: true
If you don't see these logs, the fix isn't executing properly.

üö® CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

Are you seeing the diagnostic logs above when registering a new token?
What does req.body.environment actually contain?
Is the environment logic executing at all?
Is there a different registration endpoint being used?
Why is bundle_id still null despite iOS app changes?

Please run this diagnostic logging and share the complete server logs from a fresh token registration. This will show exactly why the environment detection is still failing.
