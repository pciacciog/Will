You’re working on the Set Your Timeline (Step 1 – When) screen — the one with:

“Set Your Timeline” as the title

“When will your Will begin and end?”

Start / End date + time fields

Cancel / Next buttons

I’d like to refine both the copy/layout and the date/time selection logic so the screen feels cleaner, more intuitive, and smarter.

You can adjust spacing, styling, or exact implementation details as you see fit, as long as the behavior and intent below are respected.

1. Copy & helper text
Keep:

Title: “Set Your Timeline”

Subtitle:

Keep or use: “When will your Will begin and end?”

Add concise helper text under the subtitle (or just above the Start/End card):

“Defaults to next Mon–Sun.”

This is just to explain why the fields are pre-filled the way they are. Keep it small and muted (helper text style).

Remove redundant format hints

Please remove the “MM/DD/YYYY” and “HH:MM” labels under each field — they’re visually noisy and redundant when we’re already showing formatted dates like “Dec 1, 2025”.

2. Default weekly template behavior (Mon–Sun)

We already have the behavior that:

Start defaults to next Monday

End defaults to the following Sunday

Please keep that, but make sure it’s aligned with the helper text “Defaults to next Mon–Sun.”

If you need to recompute:

On load, calculate the next Monday in the future (relative to “now”)

Set End = Start + 6 days

3. Smart constraints for Start date/time (no past values)

Right now, the user can scroll to a past date/time even though the system ultimately prevents it. I’d like this to be smarter and more intuitive:

The Start picker should not allow selecting any moment in the past.

The earliest selectable Start should be:

“right now” or

the next rounded time slot (e.g., next 15-minute block) — use your judgment here.

Implementation-wise, please:

Use the appropriate props for the picker to set a minimum date/time (e.g., minDate, minimumDate, or equivalent), based on the current time.

Ideally, the picker also initially scrolls to that minimum value so the user lands in the valid region right away.

The user should never be able to actually select a past time as Start — those options should be disabled / not reachable.

4. Smart constraints for End date/time (must be after Start)

The End picker should only show valid options after the chosen Start:

Once the user sets a Start date/time, the End date/time:

must be ≥ Start

should use Start as its minimum date/time (minDate / minimumDate).

Behavior I’d like:

When Start changes, if the current End is now before Start, automatically bump End forward:

e.g., default to Start + 6 days (to preserve the weekly feel), or at least set End = Start.

The user should not be allowed to scroll/select an End that is earlier than Start — those options should be disabled.

Again, use the appropriate picker props to enforce this at the UI level, not just with validation errors.

5. Buttons & layout

Primary CTA remains: “Next” (no need to change this).

Keep Cancel as the secondary action.

There is currently a small “?” button between Cancel and Next in the design.

If you think it adds value as a help/info trigger, you can keep it and wire it to a short explanation of how the timeline works.

If it feels confusing or redundant given the new helper text, feel free to remove it — use your judgment for what makes the screen feel clean and intentional.

6. Overall UX goals

The user should immediately understand why dates are pre-filled (weekly template), via the short helper text.

They should never waste time tapping invalid times (no past Start, no End before Start).

The interface should feel simple, calm, and premium — less clutter (no redundant format hints), clear hierarchy.

Deliverables

Updated JSX + styling for this screen:

subtitle + helper text

Start/End inputs without “MM/DD/YYYY / HH:MM” hints

Smart constraints on the date/time pickers:

Start: cannot be in the past

End: cannot be before Start

Any optional improvements you add (e.g., better alignment, minor animations, or a helpful info popover if you keep the “?” button).

A brief explanation of what you changed and how the Start/End selection logic now works from the user’s perspective.
