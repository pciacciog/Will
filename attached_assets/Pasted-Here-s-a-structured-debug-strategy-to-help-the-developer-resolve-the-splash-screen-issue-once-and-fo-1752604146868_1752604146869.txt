Here's a structured debug strategy to help the developer resolve the splash screen issue once and for all, without relying on guessing or excessive logging.

✅ Problem Summary
Login/auth succeeds

Splash logic is triggered (e.g., showSplash = true)

But the Splash screen never renders

Then → app crashes to 404, possibly due to navigation failing or unmounted component

🧠 Likely Root Causes
Component unmount before Splash can render
➤ If Home is mounting while splash logic is still loading, React might unmount a screen before it even gets shown.

Incorrect route render logic
➤ Maybe conditional rendering in the Home route (e.g. if (!showSplash) return null) is not allowing splash screen to mount.

Routing race condition
➤ React Router might render before localStorage state (or auth state) is fully available.

React Query or Context state desync
➤ Splash visibility is tied to a state (context/localStorage/query) that updates after render, but it’s not triggering a re-render.

🛠️ Suggested Solution Path
✅ Step 1: Decouple Routing from Splash State
Make sure Home always renders something—even just a blank screen—while determining splash state.

tsx
Copy
Edit
// Home.tsx (React pseudo-code)
const Home = () => {
  const [showSplash, setShowSplash] = useState(false);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const splashFlag = localStorage.getItem("showSplashOnHome");

    if (splashFlag === "true") {
      setShowSplash(true);
      setTimeout(() => {
        localStorage.removeItem("showSplashOnHome");
        setShowSplash(false);
        setLoading(false);
      }, 2000);
    } else {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);

  if (loading) return null;

  return showSplash ? (
    <SplashScreen />
  ) : (
    <MainHomeContent />
  );
};
✅ Step 2: Make Splash Always Renderable
Ensure <SplashScreen /> is mounted inside Home, not behind a routing wall

Avoid using navigation like navigate("/splash") unless Splash has a dedicated route (which causes complexity)

✅ Step 3: Remove Routing Dependency for Splash
Avoid react-router redirects for splash.

Bad:

tsx
Copy
Edit
navigate("/splash");
Better: show splash within the Home page for 2 seconds before showing the real content.

✅ Step 4: Ensure Auth Flow Sets Flag Early
In login mutation:

ts
Copy
Edit
onSuccess: () => {
  localStorage.setItem("showSplashOnHome", "true");
  navigate("/");
}
✅ Step 5: Confirm Re-render Triggers
Make sure you call setShowSplash(true) inside useEffect, not just set state without a trigger.

Use console.log("Rendering splash screen") directly in SplashScreen to confirm render.

Login mutation success
↓
→ Set localStorage splash flag
→ Navigate to "/"
↓
Home mounts
↓
→ Reads splash flag
→ Shows splash screen for 2s
↓
→ Shows main Home content
✅ Final Checklist
✅ Checkpoint	Status
Login success sets splash flag	✅
Splash flag is read in Home	❓
Splash screen renders in Home	❓
No route change required for splash	✅
State updates trigger re-render	❓

Let me know if you’d like me to draft a complete Home.tsx or SplashScreen.tsx based on this approach.
