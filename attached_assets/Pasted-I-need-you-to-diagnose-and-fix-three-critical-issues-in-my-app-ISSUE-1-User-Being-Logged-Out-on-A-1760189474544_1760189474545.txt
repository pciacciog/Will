I need you to diagnose and fix three critical issues in my app:
ISSUE #1: User Being Logged Out on App Close
The app is logging users out every time they close the app, forcing them to re-authenticate. I need persistent authentication sessions.
Please:

Check where and how authentication tokens are currently being stored
Verify if we're using persistent storage (AsyncStorage, SecureStore, Keychain, etc.) or just memory/state
Review the app initialization/launch flow to see if we're checking for existing tokens on startup
Show me the current authentication persistence implementation
Provide a solution to keep users logged in across app sessions unless they manually log out

ISSUE #2: Notifications Being Sent to Wrong Users
A user who is NOT in my inner circle group received a notification that said "all members acknowledged - you can start a new Will!" This notification should ONLY go to members within the specific circle that completed the Will.
Please:

Locate the code that sends the "all members acknowledged" notification
Show me how we're currently determining which users receive this notification
Check if we're properly filtering by circle_id or circle membership
Identify why a user outside the circle might be receiving these notifications
Fix the logic to ensure notifications are ONLY sent to users within the specific inner circle group

ISSUE #3: Delayed Will Status Updates
Will statuses are not updating in real-time. For example, when a Will is supposed to end at 9:10 PM and change to "end room scheduled" status, the status doesn't actually update until 9:13 PM or later.
Please:

Show me how will status updates are currently being triggered (polling interval, manual refresh, etc.)
Identify the current refresh/polling frequency
Check if there's any background job or cron job handling status transitions
Show me where status checks happen in the frontend
Provide solutions to make status updates more instantaneous (more aggressive polling, real-time listeners, push notifications, etc.)

For each issue, please show me the relevant code sections and explain what's causing the problem before implementing fixes.
