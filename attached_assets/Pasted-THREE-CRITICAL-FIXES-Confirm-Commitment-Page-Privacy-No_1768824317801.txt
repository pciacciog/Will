THREE CRITICAL FIXES: Confirm Commitment Page & Privacy Note Placement

Hey! I found three issues with the privacy notes and daily reminder settings:

1. MISSING PRIVACY NOTE IN SHARED WILL "CONFIRM COMMITMENT" PAGE

Issue:
- When joining a Shared Will, on the "Confirm Commitment" page
- There's NO privacy note about the "Because/Why" being private
- This was supposed to be added but it's missing

Required Fix:
- Add a subtle note in parentheses after the "Because" label
- Text: "Because (Private - only you can see this)"
- Or: "Because (your why is private)"
- Make it subtle, in smaller/lighter text, in parentheses
- Should appear right after the word "Because" on that page

2. WHERE IS DAILY REMINDER IN SHARED WILL SEQUENCE?

Question:
- I requested adding daily reminder settings to the Shared Will joining flow
- I don't see it anywhere in the "Confirm Commitment" page
- Was this implemented? 
- If not, please add it to the "Confirm Commitment" page as described in my previous message
- If yes, where is it located?

Please confirm whether daily reminder settings were added for joining members, and if so, show me where.

3. PRIVACY NOTE PLACEMENT IS WRONG (BOTH NORMAL & SHARED SEQUENCES)

Current Issue:
- The privacy note "Private - only you can see this" appears BELOW the "I will" statement
- This is MISLEADING because it makes it look like the Will statement is private
- But the Will statement is NOT private - everyone can see it!
- What's PRIVATE is the "Because/Why" statement

Current (WRONG) placement:
What would you like to do?
I will
[text input]
Private - only you can see this  ← WRONG LOCATION
Because
[text input]

Required (CORRECT) placement:
What would you like to do?
I will
[text input]
Because (Private - only you can see this)  ← CORRECT LOCATION
[text input]

Or alternative format:
What would you like to do?
I will
[text input]
Because
Private - only you can see this  ← Also acceptable, but must be clearly tied to Because
[text input]

CRITICAL POINT:
- The privacy note must be CLEARLY associated with the "Because/Why" section
- NOT with the "I will" section
- The "I will" commitment is PUBLIC (everyone in the circle sees it)
- The "Because/Why" is PRIVATE (only you see it)
- Current placement creates confusion
