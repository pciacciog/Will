CLARIFY: TWO GOAL TYPES - YOUR IMPLEMENTATION

Hey! I want to make sure I understand exactly how you've implemented the two different tracking types. Can you explain your understanding and what you built?

MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE TWO TYPES:

**ONE-TIME TRACKING:**
- For goals like "Call my grandmother this week"
- Qualitative, single-event commitments
- NO tracking during the Will
- NO daily check-ins
- NO progress to measure
- Only asks at the END: "Did you do it?"
- Answer: Yes/No/More or Less
- History shows: Final status only

**DAILY TRACKING:**
- For goals like "Don't hit snooze this week"
- Quantitative, repeated habits
- Daily check-ins throughout the Will
- Each day: "Did you do it today?"
- Measures progress: 6/7 days = 85%
- History shows: Calendar + success rate

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

1. **Explain your understanding:**
   - How do YOU understand the difference between these two types?
   - What makes them fundamentally different in the app?

2. **Show me what you coded:**
   - How did you implement one-time tracking?
   - How did you implement daily tracking?
   - What happens differently for each type?

3. **Walk me through the flows:**
   
   **For One-Time:**
   - During creation: What does user see?
   - During the Will (Day 1-6): What happens?
   - At the end (Day 7): What happens?
   - In History: What's displayed?
   
   **For Daily Tracking:**
   - During creation: What does user see?
   - During the Will (each day): What happens?
   - At the end: What happens?
   - In History: What's displayed?

4. **Concrete examples:**
   
   Show me exactly what the app does for:
   - "Call my grandmother this week" (7 days, one-time)
   - "Don't hit snooze this week" (7 days, daily)
   
   Day by day, what should I expect?

5. **Data structure:**
   - How is one-time tracking stored in the database?
   - How is daily tracking stored?
   - What's in the `will_check_ins` table for each?

6. **History display:**
   - What does a one-time Will show in History?
   - What does a daily tracked Will show in History?
   - What data is available in each case?

7. **Any differences from my understanding:**
   - Did you implement it differently than I described?
   - Are there any edge cases I should know about?
   - Anything that doesn't work as expected yet?

WHY I'M ASKING:

I want to test this thoroughly and understand exactly what you built so I can:
- Know what to test
- Know what to expect
- Explain it to my testers
- Make sure it matches the original vision

Can you walk me through your implementation?

Thanks!
