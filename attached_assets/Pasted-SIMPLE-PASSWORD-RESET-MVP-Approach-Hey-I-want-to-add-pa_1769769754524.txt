SIMPLE PASSWORD RESET - MVP Approach

Hey! I want to add password reset functionality, but I'm building an MVP and not very tech-savvy. What's the simplest, cleanest way to implement this without overcomplicating things?

MY SITUATION:
- Building an MVP (not a massive production app yet)
- Limited technical experience
- Want something functional but not complex
- Don't need enterprise-grade security features

SIMPLIFIED APPROACH OPTIONS:

I'm thinking there might be a few simple ways to do this. Which would you recommend?

**Option 1: Simple Email Reset (Basic)**
- User clicks "Forgot Password"
- Enters email
- Gets email with reset link
- Clicks link, sets new password
- Uses a simple email service (like Resend or similar)

Is this doable without too much complexity? What's the minimum I need to set up?

**Option 2: Contact Support (Simplest)**
- "Forgot Password" shows a message: "Email support@willapp.com to reset your password"
- I manually verify and reset passwords when users contact me
- No code needed, just manual process

Too basic? Or acceptable for MVP?

**Option 3: Something else?**
Is there another simple approach I'm not thinking of?

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

1. **Recommendation:** Which option makes most sense for an MVP?

2. **If Email Reset:** 
   - What's the absolute simplest email service to use?
   - Can you give me a bare-bones implementation?
   - What's the minimum code needed?
   - How much setup/configuration required?

3. **If Manual Support:**
   - How do I safely reset a user's password in the database?
   - What's the secure way to do this manually?

4. **MVP Reality Check:**
   - How many users typically need password resets?
   - Is this even a priority for early MVP?
   - Can I launch without it and add later?

MY PREFERENCE:

Something that:
- ✅ Takes minimal time to implement
- ✅ Doesn't require learning complex new systems
- ✅ Works well enough for MVP stage
- ✅ Can be upgraded later if needed

I'd rather have something simple that works than spend days building a complex system I don't fully understand. What do you recommend?

Thanks! 🙏
