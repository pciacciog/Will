🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Why Device Tokens Aren't Auto-Registering
🚨 THE PROBLEM
Current Issue: After deleting and reinstalling the app, new device tokens are NOT being automatically registered in the database, causing push notifications to fail.
What we need: A systematic diagnosis to identify WHERE in the token flow things are breaking.

📋 DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST
Please run through this checklist step-by-step and report your findings:
1. iOS CLIENT-SIDE DIAGNOSIS
A. Token Generation Check
swift// Check if iOS is generating device tokens at all
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    let tokenString = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02.2hhx", $0) }.joined()
    print("🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Token generated = \(tokenString)")
    
    // ADD THIS DEBUG LOG
    UserDefaults.standard.set(tokenString, forKey: "debug_last_token")
    UserDefaults.standard.set(Date().timeIntervalSince1970, forKey: "debug_token_timestamp")
    
    // Your existing token handling code here...
}
Questions to answer:

 Is didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken being called?
 What is the actual token string being generated?
 Is the token different after app reinstall?

B. API Call Check
swift// Add debugging to your token registration function
func registerTokenWithServer(_ token: String) {
    print("🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Attempting to register token \(token.prefix(10))...")
    print("🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: API endpoint = \(apiEndpoint)")
    print("🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Network reachable = \(isNetworkReachable)")
    
    // Add timestamp logging
    let timestamp = Date().timeIntervalSince1970
    UserDefaults.standard.set(timestamp, forKey: "debug_last_api_call")
    
    // Your existing API call code...
}
Questions to answer:

 Is the token registration function being called?
 What is the exact API endpoint being called?
 Is the network available when the call is made?
 What are the request parameters being sent?

C. API Response Check
swift// Add response debugging
.responseJSON { response in
    print("🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: API Response Status = \(response.response?.statusCode ?? -1)")
    print("🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: API Response Body = \(response.result)")
    print("🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: API Error = \(response.error?.localizedDescription ?? "none")")
    
    // Log response details
    UserDefaults.standard.set(response.response?.statusCode ?? -1, forKey: "debug_last_status_code")
    if let data = response.data {
        UserDefaults.standard.set(String(data: data, encoding: .utf8), forKey: "debug_last_response")
    }
}
Questions to answer:

 What HTTP status code is being returned?
 What is the actual response body?
 Are there any network errors?

2. BACKEND API DIAGNOSIS
A. Endpoint Availability Check
bash# Test if the registration endpoint exists and responds
curl -X POST http://your-server.com/api/device-token/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"diagnostic_test","platform":"ios","environment":"sandbox"}' \
  -v
Questions to answer:

 Does the /api/device-token/register endpoint exist?
 What status code does it return for test requests?
 Is it properly configured in your routing?

B. Request Logging
Add this to your registration endpoint:
javascriptapp.post('/api/device-token/register', (req, res) => {
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Registration endpoint hit');
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Request body:', JSON.stringify(req.body));
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Request headers:', JSON.stringify(req.headers));
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Timestamp:', new Date().toISOString());
    
    // Your existing endpoint code...
});
Questions to answer:

 Is the endpoint being hit when iOS makes the call?
 What data is actually being received in req.body?
 Are the request headers correct?

C. Database Operation Check
javascript// Add database debugging
try {
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Attempting database insert');
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Token to insert:', token);
    
    const result = await db.query(
        'INSERT INTO device_tokens (token, platform, environment) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING *',
        [token, platform, environment]
    );
    
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Database insert successful');
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Inserted record:', result.rows[0]);
    
} catch (error) {
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Database insert failed');
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Database error:', error.message);
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Error stack:', error.stack);
}
Questions to answer:

 Is the database query being executed?
 Are there any SQL errors?
 Is the token actually being inserted into the database?

3. DATABASE DIAGNOSIS
A. Table Structure Check
sql-- Verify the device_tokens table exists and has correct structure
\d device_tokens;

-- Check if there are any constraints or triggers that might be preventing inserts
SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(c.oid) 
FROM pg_constraint c 
JOIN pg_class t ON c.conrelid = t.oid 
WHERE t.relname = 'device_tokens';
Questions to answer:

 Does the device_tokens table exist?
 What is the exact table structure?
 Are there any constraints that might prevent inserts?

B. Recent Activity Check
sql-- Check for any recent token insertions
SELECT * FROM device_tokens 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check total number of tokens in the table
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_tokens FROM device_tokens;

-- Check for any tokens without user associations
SELECT COUNT(*) as pending_tokens 
FROM device_tokens 
WHERE user_id IS NULL;
Questions to answer:

 Are any tokens being inserted at all?
 How many total tokens exist in the database?
 Are there pending tokens waiting for user association?

4. AUTHENTICATION FLOW DIAGNOSIS
A. Login Process Check
javascript// Add debugging to login endpoint
app.post('/api/auth/login', (req, res) => {
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Login endpoint hit');
    console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Device token in request:', req.body.deviceToken);
    
    // After successful authentication
    if (req.body.deviceToken) {
        console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Attempting token association');
        // Your token association code...
    } else {
        console.log('🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: No device token provided in login');
    }
});
Questions to answer:

 Is the device token being included in login requests?
 Is the token association code being executed?
 Are there any errors during the association process?


🧪 SYSTEMATIC TEST PROCEDURE
Step 1: Fresh Install Test

Delete app completely
Reinstall app
Immediately check iOS logs - look for token generation
Check server logs - look for API calls
Check database - look for new token entries

Step 2: Network Timing Test

Fresh install with airplane mode ON
Turn airplane mode OFF after app launch
Check if token registration happens when network returns
Look for retry attempts in logs

Step 3: API Isolation Test
bash# Test the API endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://your-server.com/api/device-token/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"manual_test_123","platform":"ios","environment":"sandbox"}'
Then check if this token appears in the database.

🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOMES
If everything is working correctly:

iOS generates token → Server logs show API call → Database shows new record
User logs in → Server logs show association → Database shows user_id populated
Push notification sent → Notification received

Common failure points to investigate:

iOS not calling the API at all
API endpoint not configured/reachable
Database constraints preventing inserts
Network timing issues
Authentication flow not including token
Token association logic not running


🚨 CRITICAL QUESTIONS
Answer these to identify the root cause:

When you delete/reinstall the app, do you see ANY logs related to device tokens?
Is the registration API endpoint being called at all?
Are there any database errors in the server logs?
Does a manual API call work when you test it directly?
Is the token being included when the user logs in?

Once we identify WHERE the process breaks, we can fix the specific issue rather than rebuilding everything.
