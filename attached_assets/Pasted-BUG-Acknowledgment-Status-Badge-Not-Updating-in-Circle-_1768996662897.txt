BUG: Acknowledgment Status Badge Not Updating in Circle Results

Hey! I found a bug with the acknowledgment status display after a Will completes.

THE SITUATION:

Circle: 48KHGR
Members: Jack and Bebo
Will: Shared Will "will test will" (Jan 21, 2026 6:43 AM - 6:44 AM)
Status: Completed

WHAT HAPPENED:

1. Will completed ✅
2. Bebo clicked "Acknowledge" ✅
3. Modal correctly shows "Ready for new Will once all members acknowledge: 1/2" ✅
4. BUT: Status badge next to Bebo's name in circle results STILL shows "pending" ❌

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

After Bebo acknowledges:
- His status badge should update from "pending" to "acknowledged" (or checkmark, or different visual state)
- Should show in real-time that he has acknowledged
- Jack's badge should still show "pending" (since he hasn't acknowledged yet)

CURRENT BROKEN BEHAVIOR:

- Bebo's acknowledgment is recorded in database (modal shows 1/2)
- But UI doesn't update to reflect his acknowledged status
- Badge stays showing "pending" even though he acknowledged

THE BUG:

The acknowledgment action is working (data is saved), but the UI component showing circle results/member status is not refreshing/updating after acknowledgment.

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:

1. **Where is this badge displayed?**
   - What component shows the member status badges?
   - What file/component is this in?
   - Is it in the Circle Results view? Final Summary modal?

2. **How is status determined?**
   - Show me the code that decides what badge/status to show
   - What data does it check?
   - Is it checking acknowledgment status from database?

3. **Is there a cache/state issue?**
   - After acknowledging, does the component re-fetch data?
   - Or is it using cached/stale state?
   - Does the page need a refresh to show correct status?

4. **What triggers the UI update?**
   - After clicking "Acknowledge", what happens?
   - Does it trigger a refetch of Will data?
   - Does it update local state?
   - Should it invalidate a query cache?

5. **Database check:**
   Query the database to confirm acknowledgment was recorded:
