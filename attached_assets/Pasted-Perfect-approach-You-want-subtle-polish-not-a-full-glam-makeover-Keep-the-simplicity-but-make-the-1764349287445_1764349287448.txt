Perfect approach! You want subtle polish, not a full glam makeover. Keep the simplicity but make the inputs feel professional and crisp like the sign-in page.

Prompt for Replit:
"The Circle Hub now has the modern glowy design (Group A), but the StartWill flow (When/What/Why) still uses the old simple design (Group B). This creates a jarring transition. I want to subtly upgrade StartWill to feel more consistent WITHOUT making it fully glamorous.

The Problem:
Specifically the What/Why text inputs look unprofessional and "dummy looking" compared to the crisp inputs on the sign-in page.

The Goal:
Make StartWill feel professional and crisp while keeping it simple and focused (not distracting like full Group A).

Reference Point: Auth.tsx (Sign In Page)
Please examine the text input styling on the Auth page (Sign In/Sign Up).
Find:

What Input/Textarea components are used?
What className styling makes them look "crisp"?
What makes them feel professional vs "dummy"?

Show me the actual code for those inputs.

Files to Update:
1. StartWill.tsx - Step 2 (What) and Step 3 (Why)
Current problem: The Textarea inputs probably look basic/flat
Goal: Make them match the Auth page input quality
Specifically update:

Text input fields (What and Why)
Make them look crisp and professional
Match the Auth page aesthetic


Subtle Carryovers from Group A (Not Full Glamour):
Apply these sparingly to StartWill:
Background (Subtle):
tsx// Very light gradient, barely noticeable
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-50 via-white to-gray-50/50">
Not the heavy to-purple-50/30 or to-emerald-50/30 - just a whisper of gradient.
Card Styling (Refined):
tsx// Clean shadow, no glow effects
<Card className="shadow-lg rounded-xl border bg-white">
Not shadow-xl with border-2 border-purple-100/70 - keep it clean.
Input Styling (Crisp - THIS IS KEY):
Copy the exact input styling from Auth.tsx to StartWill.tsx.
Examples of what makes inputs look crisp:

Proper border styling (border-2 vs border)
Focus states (focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary)
Padding (px-4 py-3 vs minimal padding)
Typography (text-base with proper leading)
Background (bg-white vs transparent)
Transitions (transition-all duration-200)

Typography (Professional):
tsx// Clean, readable hierarchy
<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What will you do?</h2>
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-4">Your commitment</p>

What NOT to Add:
❌ Blur effects (blur-2xl, blur-lg)
❌ Animated pulses (animate-pulse)
❌ Heavy glows on cards
❌ Gradient backgrounds on cards
❌ Multiple shadow layers
❌ Hover animations
Keep it focused and clean - this is a form, not a showcase.

Specific Instructions:
Step 1: Find Auth.tsx Input Styling
Show me the code for text inputs on the Auth page. Example:
tsx// In Auth.tsx, find inputs like:
<Input
  type="email"
  placeholder="Email"
  className="..."
/>

<Input
  type="password"
  placeholder="Password"
  className="..."
/>
Step 2: Apply Same Styling to StartWill Textareas
In StartWill.tsx, update the What and Why textareas:
tsx// Step 2 (What) - Current (probably basic):
<Textarea
  value={formData.what}
  onChange={...}
  placeholder="I will..."
  maxLength={75}
/>

// Step 2 (What) - Updated with Auth-style crisp inputs:
<Textarea
  value={formData.what}
  onChange={...}
  placeholder="I will..."
  maxLength={75}
  className="[COPY EXACT CLASSES FROM AUTH INPUTS]
    // Should include things like:
    // border-2, px-4, py-3, rounded-lg, 
    // focus:ring-2, transition-all, etc.
  "
/>
Same for Step 3 (Why).
Step 3: Add Subtle Polish to Container
tsx// Very light gradient background (barely visible)
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-50 via-white to-gray-50/50">
  
  {/* Step container - clean card */}
  <Card className="shadow-lg rounded-xl border bg-white max-w-2xl mx-auto">
    <CardContent className="p-8">
      {/* Steps content */}
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
</div>
