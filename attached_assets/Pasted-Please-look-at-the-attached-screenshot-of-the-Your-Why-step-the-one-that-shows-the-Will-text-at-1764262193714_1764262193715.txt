Please look at the attached screenshot of the “Your Why” step (the one that shows:

the Will text at the top: "I will Test"

“Your Why – Private, only you can see this”

the “Because” label

the multi-line text field

Back / Next buttons

Right now, the layout feels visually unpolished:

The “Because” label sits inside/over the text area border and makes the text field look like it’s “spilling over” the container.

The text box seems to have multiple borders / strong blue outlines, which feels heavy and not very premium.

The "I will Test" quote at the top looks a bit like it’s just floating, without a clear container.

Overall spacing/padding doesn’t feel very intentional.

I’d like you to refine this screen so it feels calmer, more professional, and consistent with a premium iOS experience, while still keeping the same basic function.

Guidance (you can interpret and adapt as you think best):

Label & text area relationship

Ideally, “Because” should sit outside the text area, above it, like a normal label.

The text area itself should be a clean, single bordered field – no overlapping label inside the border.

Text area styling

Try to avoid the “double border” / thick blue outline look.

Use a single, subtle border with rounded corners and good padding so it feels spacious.

On focus, a slight color change or a slightly stronger border is fine, but it should still look minimal and intentional.

Will quote at the top

Consider placing "I will Test" (the Will statement) inside a simple, light card or container so it feels anchored to the layout and visually distinct from the input below, instead of floating.

Spacing & hierarchy

Add consistent spacing between:

the Will statement and the “Your Why” section

the “Your Why” label, the privacy subtitle, the “Because” label, and the text area

The overall screen should feel balanced and easy on the eyes.

Copy / structure

You don’t need to change the text content unless something feels off – the main goal is visual clarity and layout.

If you think “Because” can be expressed more cleanly (e.g., just using “Your Why” as the label and a single text area), feel free to propose a small improvement.

Please:

Adjust the layout and styling of this screen according to these principles, using your judgment to keep it aligned with the rest of the app’s design system.

Briefly explain what you changed and why (especially how you handled the “Because” label, borders, and spacing).

The main goal is for this screen to feel clean, intentional, and premium – not like the text is spilling out of the container.
