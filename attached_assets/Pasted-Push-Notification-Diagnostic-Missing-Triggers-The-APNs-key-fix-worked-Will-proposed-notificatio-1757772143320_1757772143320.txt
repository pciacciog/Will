Push Notification Diagnostic: Missing Triggers
The APNs key fix worked - "Will proposed" notifications now send successfully. However, 5 other notification triggers are NOT working. I need you to diagnose why these aren't firing:
Expected Notification Triggers (only #1 works):

‚úÖ WORKING: Will Proposed - When creator starts a new Will

Title: "New Will proposed! üìù"
Body: "[Creator Name] has proposed starting a new will"


‚ùå NOT WORKING: Will Started - When Will becomes active (all committed + start date arrives)

Title: "Your Will has started! üéØ"
Body: "Time to begin your commitment: '[Will Title]'"


‚ùå NOT WORKING: End Room 24h Before - Day before End Room ceremony

Title: "End Room tomorrow üìÖ"
Body: "Your End Room ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow at [time]"


‚ùå NOT WORKING: End Room 15min Before - Quarter hour before ceremony

Title: "End Room starting soon ‚è∞"
Body: "Your End Room ceremony starts in 15 minutes"


‚ùå NOT WORKING: End Room Live - When End Room ceremony begins

Title: "End Room is live! üé≠"
Body: "Join now for your circle's reflection ceremony"


‚ùå NOT WORKING: Ready for New Will - After Will completed and all acknowledged

Title: "Ready for new Will! üöÄ"
Body: "All members acknowledged - you can start a new Will!"



Diagnostic Tasks Needed:
1. Will State Transition Logic:

Show code that changes Will status from pending ‚Üí scheduled ‚Üí active
Check if notification #2 is triggered when Will becomes active at start date
Verify if there's a scheduler/cron job that activates Wills at their start time

2. End Room Scheduler Analysis:

Examine EndRoomScheduler that runs every minute
Check if it calculates 24h before, 15min before, and "live" timing
Verify if notification sends are implemented for these 3 End Room events

3. Will Completion Logic:

Show code that handles Will completion and acknowledgment tracking
Check if notification #6 is triggered when all members acknowledge
Verify the logic that determines when a circle is "ready for new Will"

4. Missing Implementation Search:

Search entire codebase for notification triggers #2-#6
Identify which are completely missing vs partially implemented
Show any TODO comments or incomplete notification code

Expected Output Format:
=== NOTIFICATION TRIGGER STATUS ===
1. Will Proposed: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
2. Will Started: [‚ùå MISSING / ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL / ‚úÖ FOUND] at [location]
3. End Room 24h: [‚ùå MISSING / ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL / ‚úÖ FOUND] at [location] 
4. End Room 15min: [‚ùå MISSING / ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL / ‚úÖ FOUND] at [location]
5. End Room Live: [‚ùå MISSING / ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL / ‚úÖ FOUND] at [location]
6. Ready New Will: [‚ùå MISSING / ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL / ‚úÖ FOUND] at [location]
