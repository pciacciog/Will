Hey, I’d like to redesign this screen so that it fits entirely on a single iPhone screen (no scrolling required).  Here's the strategy:

✅ OVERALL GOAL
Maximize information density while preserving clarity. We can achieve this by consolidating cards, tightening spacing, and using smaller text and layout tricks.

🔧 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
1. Page Title
    * Add "Will" as the top title (centered).
    * Style: text-xl font-semibold text-center mb-2
2. Combine Proposed Timeline + End Room Meeting
    * Merge these into one compact card or section.
    * Suggested layout: yaml CopyEdit   🗓️ Timeline
    * • Start: Jul 13, 1:25 PM
    * • End: Jul 13, 1:30 PM
    * 
    * 📹 End Room
    * • Scheduled: Jul 13, 1:33 PM
    * • Duration: 30 min
    *   
    * Use text-sm, leading-tight, and maybe a two-column layout (grid-cols-2 or flex flex-col with tight spacing).
3. Commitments Section
    * Add section title: "Circle Commitments" above the list.
    * Consolidate all members into a single compact list.
    * Layout example: css CopyEdit   ✅ Randy Orton — “I will: U”
    * 🕒 John Doe — Pending submission
    *   
    * No need for a separate card per member. Use divide-y or simple spacing instead.
4. Call-to-Action (if applicable)
    * Keep "Submit My Commitment" section, but slim it down.
    * Reduce text and button padding:
        * Use text-sm, py-2, px-4 for the button.
        * Shorten body text if needed.
5. Back to Hub Button
    * Slim and place at the bottom with minimal vertical margin/padding.

🧩 Layout & Tailwind Notes:
* Use compact classes: text-sm, gap-1, leading-tight, space-y-1, divide-y, py-2 px-3
* Avoid full-width padding-heavy cards
* Aim to fit everything above the fold on a standard iPhone screen
Let me know if you need visuals — the goal is clean, readable, and all-in-one glanceable layout.


Finally I’d like to standardize this “Will Details” screen layout so that it always fits within one mobile screen (no scrolling), regardless of what state the Will is in (Scheduled, Active, End Room Pending, etc.). Goal:
Unify the structure across all phases so the Will Details screen always fits into a single mobile page for a clean, professional user experience.
