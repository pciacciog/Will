"We're updating the naming from 'Inner Circle' to 'Circle Mode' for better clarity and parallel naming with Solo Mode. Please make these updates carefully to avoid breaking existing functionality.

Changes to Make:
1. Home.tsx (Mode Selection Page)
Find the Circle card and update:
Title:
tsx// Current:
<h3>Inner Circle</h3>

// Change to:
<h3>Circle Mode</h3>
Tagline:
tsx// Current:
<p className="...italic">"Grow... together"</p>

// Change to:
<p className="...italic">"Become more... together"</p>
Keep the description intact (whatever it currently says about being part of a circle).

2. InnerCircleHub.tsx (Hub Page Title)
Change the page title:
tsx// Current (probably):
<h1>Inner Circle Hub</h1>

// Change to:
<h1>Circle</h1>
Or if there's a more elaborate header:
tsx// Current:
<h1 className="...">
  <Users className="..." />
  Inner Circle Hub
</h1>

// Change to:
<h1 className="...">
  <Users className="..." />
  Circle
</h1>
Keep the subtitle/tagline if there is one (like "Become more... together" or similar).

3. Navigation Routes (Optional - Be Careful)
Current routes:

/hub → Inner Circle Hub
/start-will → Circle Will creation

Potential new routes (ONLY if it's simple and safe):

/circle or /circle/hub → Circle Hub
/circle/start-will → Circle Will creation

BUT:

⚠️ Check for ALL references to /hub before changing
⚠️ Ensure redirects/navigation won't break
⚠️ Test that existing Wills still load correctly

If route changes would be complex, SKIP THIS and just update the display names. Routes are internal - users don't see them.

4. Search for Other References
Search the codebase for display text that might need updating:
bash# Find "Inner Circle" in user-facing text
rg "Inner Circle" --type tsx --type ts -g '!node_modules'

# Find "Grow... together" 
rg "Grow.*together" --type tsx --type ts -g '!node_modules'
Only update user-facing text, NOT:

Variable names
Function names
API endpoint names
Database fields
File names


What NOT to Change:
❌ File names: InnerCircleHub.tsx (keep as-is)
❌ Component names: InnerCircleHub (keep as-is)
❌ Database tables: inner_circles (keep as-is)
❌ API routes: /api/circles/* (keep as-is)
❌ Variable names: innerCircle, circleId (keep as-is)
Only change user-visible text and optionally frontend routes.

Testing Checklist:
After making changes, verify:
Mode Selection:

 Card shows "Circle Mode" title ✅
 Tagline shows "Become more... together" ✅
 Description unchanged ✅
 Clicking navigates correctly ✅

Circle Hub:

 Page title shows "Circle" ✅
 All functionality works ✅
 Navigation still works ✅

No Breaks:

 Existing circle Wills still load ✅
 Creating new Wills works ✅
 All links/navigation functional ✅


Implementation Priority:

✅ Easy & Safe: Update display text in Home.tsx and InnerCircleHub.tsx
⚠️ Optional: Update frontend routes (only if simple)
❌ Skip: Backend/database changes (not needed)

Please start with #1 (display text updates) and only proceed to #2 (routes) if it won't cause complications. If changing routes looks risky, just update the display names and we're done.
Show me the updated display text and confirm everything still works!"
