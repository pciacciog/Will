Restructure Active Wills Display for Better UX
Problem: Showing all active Wills on homepage will get cluttered 
Solution: Dashboard overview on homepage + dedicated "My Wills" page with proper organization.

Changes Needed:
1. Homepage - Show Summary Card Instead of Full List
Replace current active Wills list with summary card:


typescript
// On Homepage (Home.tsx)

<div className="summary-card">
  <div className="header">
    <h3>📊 Active Wills</h3>
    <span className="count">{activeWills.length}</span>
  </div>
  
  <div className="stats">
    <div>🔥 {needsCheckInToday} due today</div>
    <div>✅ {onTrack} on track</div>
  </div>
  
  <button onClick={() => navigate('/wills')}>
    View All →
  </button>
</div>
Don't show full Will cards on homepage - just summary.

2. Create New Page: "My Wills" (/wills)
New file: client/src/pages/MyWills.tsx
Structure:


typescript
// Organize Wills into sections

const soloWills = activeWills.filter(will => !will.circle_id);
const circleWills = activeWills.filter(will => will.circle_id);

return (
  <>
    <Header title="My Wills" backButton />
    
    {soloWills.length > 0 && (
      <section>
        <h2>Solo Wills ({soloWills.length})</h2>
        {soloWills.map(will => (
          <WillCard key={will.id} will={will} />
        ))}
      </section>
    )}
    
    {circleWills.length > 0 && (
      <section>
        <h2>Circle Wills ({circleWills.length})</h2>
        {circleWills.map(will => (
          <WillCard key={will.id} will={will} />
        ))}
      </section>
    )}
  </>
);
Each WillCard shows:
* Title/commitment
* Type (Ongoing / X days remaining)
* Progress (if applicable)
* Quick "Check In" button
* Tap card → Navigate to full Will details

3. Update Routes
Add route for new page:


typescript
<Route path="/wills" element={<MyWills />} />
```

---

### **4. Optional: Add to Bottom Nav**

If you want quick access from anywhere:
```
[Home] [My Wills] [Circles] [Profile]

Goal: Homepage stays clean with just a summary. Users tap "View All" to see organized list of all their Wills (Solo vs Circle sections). Scalable for any number of Wills.

Does this structure make sense? Should we go with sections (Solo/Circle) or tabs? Maybe tabs might be clean. Whatever is more elegant.
