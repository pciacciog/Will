I‚Äôve followed every recommended step to set up iOS push notifications using Capacitor and APNs, but the registration event still doesn't emit a device token. Here's a full diagnosis for context:

‚úÖ Confirmed Working
Permissions:
PushNotifications.requestPermissions() returns { receive: "granted" }

Register Call:
PushNotifications.register() executes without errors

Listeners Attached:
addListener('registration'), registrationError, pushNotificationReceived, and pushNotificationActionPerformed all attach successfully with no errors

Authentication:
Frontend is logged in and user session is active (isAuthenticated: true)

Entitlements Match:
aps-environment set to development
NODE_ENV on Replit is also development ‚Üí using APNs sandbox ‚úÖ

App Rebuild & Install:
Full uninstall from device
Then rebuilt with:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
npx cap copy ios
npx cap open ios
App installed to real device via Xcode ‚úÖ

‚ùå Still Not Working
No registration event fires

No device token returned

No registrationError either

üîç Hypotheses
Replit Backend Issue?
Even though .p8 file is configured and backend supports APNs, could there be an issue with how the backend is expected to receive tokens (e.g., /api/push-tokens endpoint or middleware blocking)?

Silent Rejection by APNs?
Apple doesn‚Äôt emit tokens if device, provisioning profile, or entitlements are subtly misaligned (e.g., missing permissions, device not added to profile, wrong capabilities, etc.)

Replit Build Layer
Is there a layer in Replit (like proxying or container networking) that might interfere with Apple‚Äôs device registration during token handoff?

Request
Could someone from Replit help:

Confirm that the backend .p8 setup is valid (already live in server)

Ensure no Replit-specific environment constraints block APNs token generation

Help debug why the registration event isn‚Äôt being triggered despite complete setup

Thank you üôè Let me know if you‚Äôd like to review the .entitlements file or device logs directly.
