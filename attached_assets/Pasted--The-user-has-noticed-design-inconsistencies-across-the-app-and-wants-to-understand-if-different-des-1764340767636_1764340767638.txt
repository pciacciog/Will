"The user has noticed design inconsistencies across the app and wants to understand if different design systems/aesthetics are being used. Please analyze and compare the styling approaches.

Pages to Analyze:
Group A: "Glowy, Aesthetically Pleasing"

Home.tsx (Start Your Journey page)
SoloHub.tsx (Solo mode hub)

Group B: "Simpler, Flatter"

Landing.tsx (first landing page)
InnerCircleHub.tsx (Circle hub)


What to Investigate:
1. Component Libraries Used
Check each file's imports:
bash# Check what UI components each page imports
rg "from ['\"]@/components/ui" client/src/pages/Home.tsx
rg "from ['\"]@/components/ui" client/src/pages/SoloHub.tsx
rg "from ['\"]@/components/ui" client/src/pages/Landing.tsx
rg "from ['\"]@/components/ui" client/src/pages/InnerCircleHub.tsx
Questions:

Do they use the same shadcn/ui components?
Are there custom design system components used in some but not others?
Any differences in import patterns?


2. CSS/Styling Approaches
Look for:
Background styles:
bash# Search for background colors/gradients
rg "bg-background|bg-gradient|bg-\[" client/src/pages/Home.tsx
rg "bg-background|bg-gradient|bg-\[" client/src/pages/Landing.tsx
Glow effects:
bash# Search for shadow/glow effects
rg "shadow-|blur|glow" client/src/pages/
Card styles:
bash# Compare Card component usage
rg "<Card" client/src/pages/Home.tsx
rg "<Card" client/src/pages/InnerCircleHub.tsx

3. Design Tokens/Themes
Check if there are different color schemes:
bash# Look for color classes
rg "text-purple|bg-purple|border-purple" client/src/pages/
rg "text-green|bg-green|border-green" client/src/pages/
rg "text-blue|bg-blue|border-blue" client/src/pages/
```

### **4. Layout Structure**

**Container widths:**
- Does Home.tsx use `max-w-2xl` or similar constraints?
- Does InnerCircleHub use full-width layouts?

**Spacing:**
- Are there differences in padding/margins (`p-4` vs `p-8`, etc.)?

---

## **Please Provide:**

### **For each of the 4 pages, document:**

1. **UI Components Used:**
   - List of shadcn/ui components imported
   - Any custom components used
   - Design system components (if any)

2. **Visual Effects:**
   - Background styles (solid, gradient, etc.)
   - Shadow/glow effects
   - Border styles
   - Color scheme (primary colors used)

3. **Layout Approach:**
   - Container constraints
   - Spacing patterns
   - Card/section styling

4. **Code Examples:**
   - Show the actual className strings for key elements
   - Show any inline styles

---

## **Comparison Format:**

Please present it like this:
```
HOME.TSX (Start Your Journey):
- Components: Card, CardContent, Button, Badge
- Background: Gradient with blur effect
- Colors: Purple accents (#...)
- Glow: Yes (blur-3xl, opacity effects)
- Layout: Centered, max-w-2xl
- Example: <Card className="border-2 hover:border-purple-500 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">

LANDING.TSX:
- Components: Button, basic divs
- Background: Solid color
- Colors: Green primary
- Glow: No
- Layout: Full width
- Example: <div className="simple flat classes">

[etc.]

Key Questions to Answer:

Are Home.tsx and SoloHub.tsx using similar design patterns? (They should be, since SoloHub was modeled after Home)
Are Landing.tsx and InnerCircleHub.tsx using a different/older design system? (User suspects they were created at the same time with simpler styles)
What specifically makes the "glowy" pages different?

Gradient backgrounds?
Box shadows?
Blur effects?
Border styles?
Hover animations?


Is there a design-system.tsx file or similar? Check if there are pre-defined design components that only some pages use.


Please analyze the code and confirm:

✅ Yes, the user is correct - there are two different design aesthetics
❌ No, they're actually consistent (and explain what the user is perceiving)
