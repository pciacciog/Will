Updated Check-In Pages - Both Flows

SCREEN 1: Set Dates Will - Check-In Page (Step 4)
Simplify to absolute minimum:
Remove:
* "Final review when complete" badge and explanation
* "REMINDER TIME" section header
* All question text ("When should we check in with you?", "When should we nudge you?")
* Any explanatory paragraphs
New layout:


┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   1 What — 2 Why — 3 When — 4   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘


Daily Reminder

We'll check in with you each day


[Cancel]  [?]  [Create Will →]
Elements:
* Title: "Daily Reminder"
* Time Picker: Prominent, centered
* Confirmation text: "We'll check in with you each day"
* Buttons: Cancel, help icon (?), Create Will

SCREEN 2: Ongoing Will - Check-In Page (Step 4)
Simplify while keeping essential ongoing elements:

* "Set your daily check-in preferences" subtitle
* "Track progress daily with yes/no/partial check-ins" explanation
* "DAILY CHECK-IN TIME" section header
* "ACTIVE DAYS" section header
* Question text ("When should we remind you to check in?", "Which days does this apply to?")
New layout:


┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   1 What — 2 Why — 3 When — 4   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Check-In Time

[8:00 PM]

We'll check in with you on your active days


[Cancel]  [?]  [Create Will →]
Elements:
* Title: "Daily Check-In"
* Active Days label: Simple text, no header styling
* Buttons: Every day / Custom
* Day selection: Shows if Custom selected
* Divider line: Separates sections
* Check-In Time label: Simple text, no header styling
* Time Picker: Standard picker
* Confirmation text: "We'll check in with you on your active days"
* Buttons: Cancel, help icon (?), Create Will

Key Consistency Between Both:
✅ Minimal question text - just labels ✅ Authoritative confirmation ("We'll check in with you...") ✅ Clean typography - no ALL CAPS headers ✅ Same button layout at bottom ✅ Help icon (?) for explanations if needed
Difference:
* Set Dates: Just time (simpler)
* Ongoing: Active Days + Time (what's needed for data tracking)

Please implement both simplified check-in pages following these exact layouts.
