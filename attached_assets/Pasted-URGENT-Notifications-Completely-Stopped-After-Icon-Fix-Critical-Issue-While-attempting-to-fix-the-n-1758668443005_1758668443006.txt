URGENT: Notifications Completely Stopped After Icon Fix
Critical Issue
While attempting to fix the notification icon inconsistency, something in the code changes has completely broken notification delivery. Users are no longer receiving any push notifications.
What Should Have Happened vs What Actually Happened
Expected: Icon file updates should only affect visual appearance, not notification functionality
Reality: Notification delivery has completely stopped working
Immediate Diagnosis Required
Question 1: What exactly was changed?
Beyond updating icon files, what other code modifications were made? Please provide:

List of all files modified (not just icon files)
Any iOS configuration changes (Info.plist, entitlements, etc.)
Any server-side notification code changes
Any certificate or APNS configuration changes

Question 2: Are notifications being sent from server?
Check server logs:

Are notification requests still being processed?
Are APNS calls still being made successfully?
Are there any new error messages in server logs?
Has the APNS endpoint or certificate configuration changed?

Question 3: iOS app configuration
During the icon update, check if any of these were modified:

Bundle identifier changes?
Push notification entitlements removed or modified?
Info.plist changes related to notifications?
Any build configuration changes?

Rollback Strategy
Immediate fix: Can you revert to the previous working version while keeping only the icon file changes? This would help isolate whether:

The problem is purely from icon file corruption
Or if other code changes broke the notification system

Specific Technical Areas to Check
Server-Side Issues
javascript// Check if any of these were modified:
- APNS certificate configuration
- Environment settings (sandbox vs production)
- Device token handling logic
- Notification payload construction
iOS App Issues
swift// Check if any of these were affected:
- Push notification entitlements
- Bundle ID consistency
- Certificate provisioning profile
- didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken method
Configuration Issues

Did the icon update process modify any configuration files?
Were any build settings changed during the icon replacement?
Are there any new build errors or warnings?

Expected Response
Please provide:

Complete list of changes made (all files, not just icons)
Current server logs showing notification attempts
Any new error messages from server or iOS app
Confirmation of rollback capability to previous working version

Severity Level: CRITICAL
This breaks core app functionality. Icon updates should never affect notification delivery - this suggests either:

Unintended code changes were made alongside icon updates
The build/deployment process introduced errors
Configuration files were corrupted during the icon replacement process

Priority: Fix notification delivery first, icon consistency second.
