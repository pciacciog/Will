CLARIFICATION NEEDED: "My Circles" Flow & Navigation

Hey! I have some important questions about how the "My Circles" lobby flow should work. Need to make sure we're aligned before you implement.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR (Before Multi-Circle):
- User taps "Circle Mode"
- IF user has NO circle → Shows "Create Circle" or "Join Circle" options
- IF user HAS a circle → Goes DIRECTLY to that circle's Hub

DESIRED NEW BEHAVIOR (With Multi-Circle):
User should ALWAYS land in "My Circles" lobby first, regardless of how many circles they're in (0, 1, 2, or 3).

MAXIMUM CIRCLES: 3 per user (UPDATE: Change from 10 to 3 in your implementation plan)

SCREEN NAMING - CONFIRMED:
- Screen title/header: "My Circles"
- Back navigation text: "← My Circles" (when navigating back from a Circle Hub)
- Use "My Circles" consistently throughout the app

SCENARIO 1: User has ZERO circles
- Tap "Circle Mode" → "My Circles" screen shows:
  - Empty state message ("You're not in any circles yet")
  - [+ Create New Circle] button
  - [Join Circle with Code] button

SCENARIO 2: User has ONE circle
- Tap "Circle Mode" → "My Circles" screen shows:
  - Their one circle card (clickable to enter)
  - [+ Create New Circle] button
  - [Join Circle with Code] button
  - Maybe show "1/3 circles" indicator?

SCENARIO 3: User has TWO circles
- Tap "Circle Mode" → "My Circles" screen shows:
  - Both circle cards (clickable to enter each)
  - [+ Create New Circle] button
  - [Join Circle with Code] button
  - Maybe show "2/3 circles" indicator?

SCENARIO 4: User has THREE circles (MAXIMUM REACHED)
- Tap "Circle Mode" → "My Circles" screen shows:
  - All three circle cards (clickable to enter each)
  - NO "Create New Circle" button (hidden/removed)
  - NO "Join Circle with Code" button (hidden/removed)
  - Message: "You're in 3/3 circles (maximum)" or similar

CRITICAL POINTS: 
1. The flow should ALWAYS go through "My Circles" first. Never bypass it and go directly to a hub, even if user only has one circle.
2. Create/Join buttons should DISAPPEAR when user reaches 3 circles.
3. Maximum is 3 circles per user (UPDATE from your original plan of 10).

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

1. CURRENT FLOW CHECK:
   - Does your plan already account for this "always show My Circles first" behavior?
   - Or were you planning to bypass the lobby and go direct to hub if user has only one circle?
   - Please confirm the exact navigation flow for all scenarios above

2. THREE CIRCLE LIMIT:
   - Your plan mentioned 10 circles max - please UPDATE this to 3
   - Confirm the create/join buttons will be HIDDEN (not just disabled) at 3/3 circles
   - What message should show when user is at maximum? "You're in 3 circles (maximum)" or something else?

3. BACK NAVIGATION:
   - When user is inside a specific Circle Hub, is there a back button to return to "My Circles"?
   - Where is this back button located? (Header? Top-left?)
   - Confirm it says "← My Circles"

4. NAVIGATION HIERARCHY:
   Please confirm the complete navigation structure:
Start Your Journey
↓ tap "Circle Mode"
My Circles (ALWAYS lands here first)
↓ tap specific circle OR create/join (if under 3)
Specific Circle Hub
↓ tap "← My Circles"
My Circles (returns here)

5. EMPTY STATE (0 circles):
   - What should "My Circles" show when user has zero circles?
   - Just the create/join buttons with a message?
   - What should the empty state message say?
   - Any welcome text or explanation?

6. CIRCLE CARDS IN "MY CIRCLES":
   - What information should each circle card display?
   - Circle name (or member names if unnamed)
   - Member count? 
   - Active Will count? 
   - Last activity timestamp?
   - Any visual indicator for circles needing attention (pending Wills, active Wills, upcoming End Rooms)?

7. CIRCLE COUNTER:
   - Should we show "X/3 circles" somewhere in "My Circles" screen?
   - Where should this appear? (Top? Bottom? On each scenario?)
   - Or only show when at maximum: "3/3 circles (maximum)"?

8. CIRCLE HUB HEADER:
   - When user enters a specific Circle Hub, what does the header show?
   - Just the circle name?
   - Circle name + "← My Circles" back button?
   - Please describe the header layout

9. BOTTOM NAVIGATION:
   - When user is in "My Circles", which bottom nav item is highlighted?
   - When user is in a specific Circle Hub, which is highlighted?
   - Or does Circle Hub have its own navigation without bottom nav?

10. ATTEMPT TO JOIN 4TH CIRCLE:
    - What happens if user tries to join via invite code when they already have 3 circles?
    - Error message? 
    - Suggested text: "You've reached the maximum of 3 circles. Leave a circle to join another."

11. LEAVING A CIRCLE:
    - How does a user leave a circle they're in?
    - Is there a "Leave Circle" option in the Circle Hub?
    - What happens to active Wills when they leave?
    - Confirmation dialog before leaving?

12. CIRCLE SORTING:
    - How should circles be ordered in "My Circles"?
    - Most recent activity first?
    - Alphabetical by name?
    - Creation date?

PLEASE PROVIDE:
- Confirmation that flow ALWAYS goes through "My Circles" first (never bypasses)
- Confirmation that 3 circle maximum is implemented (UPDATE from 10)
- Confirmation that create/join buttons DISAPPEAR (not just disable) at 3/3 circles
- Explanation of back navigation from Circle Hub to "My Circles"
- Wireframe or description of empty state (0 circles)
- Description of circle card design and information displayed
- Any concerns with this "always show My Circles" approach

Want to make sure we're 100% aligned on the navigation flow and 3-circle limit before you build it!
