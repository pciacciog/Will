TRACKING FEATURE


PROGRESS TRACKING FEATURE: Daily vs One-Time Check-Ins

Hey! I want to add progress tracking to Solo and Circle Wills. Users have been asking for data to see if the app is working - they want to track their success rates and progress over time.

THE CORE IDEA:

Not all Wills are the same - some are daily habits that should be tracked every day, others are one-time commitments that only need confirmation at the end.

Examples:
- **Daily habit:** "Don't hit snooze" (7 days) → Track every single day
- **One-time task:** "Call my grandmother" (1 day) → Just confirm at the end
- **Qualitative goal:** "Be more present this week" (7 days) → Just reflect at the end

Solution: Let users choose their tracking type during Will creation, then the app behaves differently based on that choice.

IMPLEMENTATION:

**Step 1: Add Tracking Type Selection to Will Creation**

Current flow is:
1. When (duration)
2. What (commitment)
3. Why (motivation)

Add new step AFTER "Why":

4. **How to Track (NEW)**


**Step 2: Store the Tracking Type**

Add field to `wills` table:
```sql
wills (
  ...existing fields...,
  check_in_type VARCHAR -- 'daily' or 'one-time'
)
```

**Step 3: Different Behavior Based on Type**

### **DAILY CHECK-INS:**

**During the Will:**
- Send daily push notification: "Did you [commitment]?"
- Show check-in modal every day
- Modal has three options: Yes / No / Partially
- Optional reflection text
- Store each check-in

**At the End:**
- Show "Final Review" screen with all days listed
- Display success rate (e.g., "85% - 6/7 days")
- Allow editing any day (retroactive check-ins)
- “Did you Follow Through on your commitment?”

- Continue to End Room

### **ONE-TIME CHECK-IN:** 9(AS IT CURRENTLY IS RIGHT NOW)

**During the Will:**
- NO daily check-ins
- NO daily notifications about the Will
- Just let it run 

**At the End:**
- Show single check-in modal (AS IT CURRENTLY IS): "Did you [commitment]?"
- Three options: Yes / No / Partially (change “mostly” to “partially”
- Optional reflection text
- Continue to End Room

DETAILED FLOWS:

**DAILY CHECK-IN FLOW:**

**During Will (Every Day):**
Push notification at scheduled time ↓ Check-in modal appears: "Did you skip the snooze button today?" [Yes] [No] [More or Less] Optional text: "How did it go?" ↓ Store in database ↓ Update progress display


**View Progress Anytime:**
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Don't hit snooze │ │ Day 5 of 7 │ ├─────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Your Progress: │ │ M T W T F S S │ │ ✓ ✓ ✗ ✓ ✓ ? ? │ │ │ │ Success Rate: 75% (3/4 days) │ │ │ │ ⚠️ 1 missing check-in │ │ [Fill In Missing Day] │ │ │ │ [Check In Today] │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────┘


**At End of Will (Before End Room):**

Step 1 - Final Review:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Final Review │ │ Don't hit snooze • Jan 20-27 │ ├─────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Your Progress: │ │ M T W T F S S │ │ ✓ ✓ ✗ ✓ ✓ ✓ ? │ │ │ │ Success Rate: 83% (5/6 days) │ │ Missing: 1 day │ │ │ │ [Fill In Missing Days] │ │ [Looks Good, Continue] │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────┘


Step 2 - Final Reflection:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ │ How did it go? │ ├─────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Success Rate: 85% (6/7 days) 🔥 │ │ │ │ How do you feel about your │ │ progress this week? │ │ │ │ [😊 Great] [😐 Okay] [😔 Could │ │ improve] │ │ │ │ Final thoughts? (optional) │ │ [ ]│ │ │ │ [Continue to End Room] │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────┘


**ONE-TIME CHECK-IN FLOW:**

**During Will:**
- Nothing happens
- Will just sits there until end date

**At End of Will:**

Single check-in modal:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Call my grandmother │ │ Your Will just ended! │ ├─────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ │ Did you call your grandmother? │ │ │ │ [✓ Yes] [✗ No] [≈ Partially]│ │ │ │ How did it go? (optional) │ │ [ ]│ │ │ │ [Continue to End Room] │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────┘


DATABASE SCHEMA:

**New table for check-ins:**
```sql
will_check_ins (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  will_id INTEGER REFERENCES wills(id),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  date DATE, -- The day being tracked (e.g., Jan 22)
  status VARCHAR, -- 'yes', 'no', or 'more_or_less'
  reflection_text TEXT, -- Optional
  checked_in_at TIMESTAMP, -- When they actually logged it
  is_retroactive BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- Was this filled in late?
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

**Update wills table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE wills ADD COLUMN check_in_type VARCHAR DEFAULT 'one-time';
-- 'daily' or 'one-time'
```

**Optional: Store final reflection for daily Wills:**
```sql
will_reflections (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  will_id INTEGER REFERENCES wills(id),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  feeling VARCHAR, -- 'great', 'okay', or 'could_improve'
  final_thoughts TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

RETROACTIVE CHECK-INS (FILL IN MISSING DAYS):

**Key Feature:** Users can go back and fill in days they forgot to check in.

**During the Will:**
- If user missed checking in on Tuesday, they can go back on Thursday and fill it in
- Show "Fill In Missing Days" button when there are gaps
- Let them select which day to fill
- Same check-in modal appears

**At the End:**
- Show all days with their status
- Allow editing ANY day (missing or already completed)
- User confirms data is accurate before continuing

**Implementation:**
- Check-ins store the `date` being tracked + `checked_in_at` timestamp
- Can have Tuesday's check-in logged on Thursday (retroactive)
- `is_retroactive` flag for analytics (optional)

SUCCESS RATE CALCULATION:

For daily check-ins:
Success Rate = (Days marked "Yes") / (Total check-ins completed)
Example: 7 days total
* 5 days: Yes
* 1 day: No
* 1 day: More or Less
Success Rate = 5/7 = 71%
Or include "More or Less" as partial success: Success Rate = (5 + 0.5) / 7 = 78%


Your choice on how to count "More or Less"!

PROGRESS DISPLAY:

**Calendar View:**
M T W T F S S ✓ ✓ ✗ ✓ ✓ ? ?
Legend: ✓ = Yes (success) ✗ = No (didn't do it) ? = Not checked in yet
* = Future day


**Success Percentage:**
Success Rate: 75% (3/4 days)


CIRCLE WILLS:

**Important:** Each circle member has their own check-ins for their own "what" (since Circle Wills have individual commitments).

- Jack tracks HIS commitment (don't hit snooze)
- Bebo tracks HIS commitment (exercise daily)
- Both choose their own check-in type
- Both have separate check-in data
- In End Room, they can see each other's stats

IN END ROOM / HISTORY:

**Daily Tracked Will - Shows:**
Don't hit snooze Jan 20-27, 2026
M T W T F S S ✓ ✓ ✗ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Success Rate: 85% (6/7 days)


**One-Time Will - Shows:**
Call my grandmother Jan 27, 2026
Status: ✓ Yes


MY QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

1. **Database schema** - Does this structure make sense?
2. **Reusing existing modals** - Can we reuse the current check-in modal UI?
3. **Notification scheduling** - How to trigger daily vs one-time notifications?
4. **Success rate calculation** - Should "More or Less" count as 0.5 or excluded?
5. **Default setting** - Should daily Wills default to "daily check-ins"? Or always ask?
6. **Retroactive limits** - Can users fill in ANY past day, or only within the Will duration?
7. **Circle Wills** - Each member picks their own check-in type, correct?

Or based on commitment text:
- Contains "daily" or "every day" → Suggest "Daily"
- Otherwise → Let user choose

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

1. **Feasibility assessment** - Is this doable with current architecture?
2. **Implementation plan** - Step-by-step approach
3. **Complexity estimate** - How long would this take?
4. **Recommendations** - Any better ways to structure this?
5. **Technical challenges** - What issues do you foresee?

This feature would make Will much more useful - users get concrete data on their progress, which helps them see if the app is working and motivates them to keep going.

What do you think? Where should we start?
