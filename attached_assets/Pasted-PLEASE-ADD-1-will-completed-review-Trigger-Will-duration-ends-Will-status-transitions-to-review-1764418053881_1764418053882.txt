PLEASE ADD 
1) will_completed_review
Trigger: Will duration ends → Will status transitions to review.
Recipients: All participants in that Will.
Message: "Your Will is complete. Good work. Hop in to review."
Deep Link: End Room / Review screen for that Will.
Technical suggestions:
* Add fields like completedAt and completionNotificationSentAt on the Will.
* Scheduler: select Wills where endDate <= now AND status = 'active' AND completionNotificationSentAt IS NULL.
* After sending, set status = 'review' and store completionNotificationSentAt to avoid double-send.

2) commitment_reminder_incomplete
Trigger: Will is in pending / proposed state and user has not committed within 6 hours of Will creation.
Recipients: Only uncommitted users for that Will.
Message: "Your Circle is waiting for your commitment."
Deep Link: Will commitment screen for that user.
Technical suggestions:
* Store createdAt and track membership status (committed = true/false) per user+Will.
* Scheduler: for each uncommitted member, check now - will.createdAt >= 6h and commitmentReminderSentAt IS NULL.
* Save per-user flag like commitmentReminderSentAt on the membership record to ensure idempotency.

3) acknowledgment_reminder_pending
Trigger: Will is completed and user has not acknowledged within 6 hours of Will completion/review opening.
Recipients: Only members who have not yet acknowledged.
Message: "Your Circle is waiting for your acknowledgment."
Deep Link: Acknowledgment / review screen for that Will.
Technical suggestions:
* For each member+Will, track acknowledgedAt and ackReminderSentAt.
* Scheduler: check Wills with status = 'review' and now - completedAt >= 6h.
* For each member with acknowledgedAt IS NULL AND ackReminderSentAt IS NULL, send the notification and set ackReminderSentAt.

4) circle_member_joined
Trigger: New user joins an existing Circle.
Recipients: All existing members of that Circle, excluding the joiner.
Message: "[Name] joined your Circle."
Deep Link: Circle hub for that Circle.
Technical suggestions:
* Fire this synchronously on the “join circle” event (backend handler).
* Ensure you don’t resend if user rejoins repeatedly within a short window (optional: joinedAt + small cooldown).
* Use a safe display name fallback (e.g., first name or handle).

5) member_review_submitted
Trigger: A member submits their Will review / reflection.
Recipients: All other members of that Circle for the same Will.
Message: "[Name] completed their Will review."
Deep Link: Will progress / acknowledgments screen for that Will.
Technical suggestions:
* Trigger on successful save of the review (reviewSubmittedAt).
* Exclude the submitting user from recipients.
* Optionally add a per-Will+member reviewNotificationSentAt if you later allow editing, to avoid re-sending on every update.

6) will_midpoint_milestone
Trigger: Time reaches 50% of the Will duration (halfway between startDate and endDate).
Recipients: All committed participants in that Will.
Message: "You're halfway there. Keep it up."
Deep Link: Current Will dashboard.
Technical suggestions:
* Precompute a midpointAt timestamp when the Will is created or activated: (startDate + endDate) / 2.
* Add midpointNotificationSentAt on the Will.
* Scheduler: select Wills where midpointAt <= now AND midpointNotificationSentAt IS NULL AND status = 'active'.
* After sending, set midpointNotificationSentAt so it’s only sent once.

General Technical Guidelines (for all of the above)
* Idempotency: Always store a per-event timestamp/boolean (e.g., XNotificationSentAt) on the relevant Will or membership record so retries or delayed jobs don’t double-send.
* Environment separation: Make sure device tokens are tagged with environment (staging vs production) and you hit the correct APNs endpoint per environment.
* Rate limiting: Keep a simple per-user check so no more than N notifications of the same type are sent per day, if logic ever repeats or users re-enter states.
* Deep links: Standardize routes like /will/:id/review, /will/:id/commit, /circle/:id and always include the relevant IDs in the push payload.
