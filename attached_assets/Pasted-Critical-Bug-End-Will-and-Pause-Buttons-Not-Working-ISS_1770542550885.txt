Critical Bug: End Will and Pause Buttons Not Working

ISSUE: Buttons Show Success But Don't Actually Update Will Status
Affected User: porfirioaciaccio@gmail.com
Will Type: Ongoing Will created via personal mode 

Bug 1: End Will Button
Steps to Reproduce:
1. User has active ongoing Will
2. User clicks "End Will" button
3. Success message appears: "Will terminated" or "Your will has been ended"
4. BUG: Will still shows as Active
Expected Behavior:
* Will status changes from "active" to "completed" or "ended"
* Will moves out of Active Wills s
* Will appears in history/completed section
Actual Behavior:
* Success message displays
* Will remains in Active Wills
* No actual status change occurs

Bug 2: Pause Button
Steps to Reproduce:
1. User has active ongoing Will
2. User clicks "Pause" button
3. BUG: Nothing happens or shows success but Will stays active
Expected Behavior:
* Will status changes to "paused"
* Check-in notifications stop
* UI shows paused state
Actual Behavior:
* Will remains fully active
* No status change

Root Cause Investigation Needed:
Possible issues:
1. Backend call failing silently - UI shows success message before confirming backend success
2. Status not updating in database - Backend receives request but doesn't update Will status
3. UI state not refreshing - Backend updates successfully but UI doesn't re-fetch/update
4. Response handling error - Backend returns error but frontend interprets as success

What to Check:
Backend:
* Is the end/pause endpoint receiving the request?
* Is it actually updating the Will status in database?
* What response is it returning?
* Check server logs for errors
Frontend:
* Is success message shown before backend confirmation?
* Is UI state refreshed after button click?
* Are there any console errors?
* Does page need manual refresh to see changes?

Testing Steps:
1. Check database directly - what is the Will's status field after clicking "End Will"?
2. Check if a page refresh shows the updated status
3. Test with a new test Will to reproduce
4. Check both End Will and Pause buttons

Priority: HIGH
This breaks core functionality - users cannot end or pause their Wills. They're stuck with active Wills they want to stop. By the way, please end the one for Porfirio right now.


CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Ongoing Wills MUST Have Full Tracking
For ALL Ongoing active Wills, users must be able to:
1. Check in daily - Log Yes/Partial/No for each day
2. View calendar - See their full history of check-ins (green/yellow/red days)
3. See progress metrics:
    * Success rate percentage (e.g., 45/60 days = 75%)
    * Total days tracked
4. Access this anytime - From the active Will view, user can:
    * Tap to see calendar
    * Check in for today
    * Check in for past days (retroactive)
    * See their progress

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE for Ongoing Wills
Why:
* Ongoing Wills are long-term habits
* Users NEED to see progress to stay motivated
* Calendar view validates their effort
* Data tracking is the core value of ongoing commitments

Contrast with Set Dates Wills:
Ongoing Wills:
* ✅ Store all check-ins
* ✅ Show calendar view
* ✅ Calculate success rate
* ✅ Full data-driven accountability
Set Dates Wills:
* ❌ Don't store check-ins (just daily prompts)
* ❌ No calendar view during Will
* ❌ No real-time progress tracking
* ✅ Final review at end only
