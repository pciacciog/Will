Subject: App icon fix (2.3.8) — make artwork consistent + redesign hand to match spec

Why this change is required

Apple rejected 1.0 for Guideline 2.3.8 – Accurate Metadata.

Our current icon set mixes two different artworks (some show only the hand, others show hand + “WILL”). Apple expects the same artwork across all sizes to avoid user confusion.

The hand mark reads poorly at small sizes; it doesn’t clearly look like a hand.

Direction (single, consistent artwork)

Use one master design for all sizes.

No text inside the icon. Per HIG, text is illegible/fragile at small sizes and creates inconsistency.

Keep the “WILL” wordmark for marketing/screens, not inside the app icon.

Visual spec (match the attached reference)

Background: emerald gradient rounded square (iOS will mask the corners—design as a full square; don’t pre-round).

Gradient suggestion: #13A67C → #0D7F63 (top-left to bottom-right), subtle noise/texture optional but very light.

Symbol: clean outlined palm/raised hand centered.

Stroke: proportionally ~8–10% of icon width (e.g., ~82–100 px on the 1024 master).

Stroke joins/caps: round.

Color: white; no drop shadows.

Proportions: hand height ≈ 64–68% of canvas; keep safe margin ≥ 12% on all sides so iOS mask doesn’t clip.

Draw the thumb distinctly; ensure finger spacing reads at 40×40 preview.

Contrast/accessibility: WCAG AA contrast vs. background at small sizes.

Deliverables

Master source: SVG (preferred) or Figma file of the hand logo on gradient background.

1024×1024 PNG (no alpha) marketing icon.

Regenerate all iPhone sizes from the same artwork (no text):

20@2x = 40×40

20@3x = 60×60

29@2x = 58×58

29@3x = 87×87

40@2x = 80×80

40@3x = 120×120

60@2x = 120×120

60@3x = 180×180

1024×1024 (marketing, PNG no alpha)

If the target is Universal (iPhone + iPad), also export:

76×76, 152×152, 167×167.

Update AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json to map only these files. Remove any entries that include text variants.

Generator updates (if keeping the HTML tool)

Enforce single artwork mode (toggle off the “WILL” text entirely).

Lock stroke thickness and safe margins relative to canvas.

Export with exact filenames used by Contents.json.

Ensure the 1024 export has alpha removed.

QA checklist (please confirm)

 Every slot in AppIcon.appiconset uses the same artwork (no mixed “with text/without text”).

 1024×1024 is PNG without alpha.

 Icon reads clearly at 40×40 and 58×58 (no blobby fingers).

 Info.plist has no CFBundleAlternateIcons or custom icon overrides.
