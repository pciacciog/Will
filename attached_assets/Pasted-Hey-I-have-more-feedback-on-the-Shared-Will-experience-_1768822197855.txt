Hey! I have more feedback on the Shared Will experience based on testing. Four important issues to address:

1. "SHARED" STATUS NEEDS TO BE MORE PROMINENT

Current Issue:
- In the Will details section, Users need to clearly KNOW this is a Shared Will throughout the experience
- We need to make the current purple shared button visible on the circle commitments section 
- Right not it is just labelled at the top beside the will status. I needs to be more present than this. Perhaps worth by simply repeating it in the rice commitments section next to the wil info. For example: “John (name of member” will” “insert commitment” and then somewhere Label: "Shared Will" as a prominent secondary title

  

2. "CONFIRM COMMITMENT" PAGE - ADD PRIVACY NOTE

Current Issue:
- On the "Confirm Commitment" page where users write their "Why"
- There's no reminder that the "Why" is private
- Users might hesitate to be honest if they think others will see it

Required Change:
- Add a note in/near the "Because" section (where their why is displayed)
- Text suggestion: make it consistent with previous page


3. DAILY REMINDER SETTINGS FOR JOINING MEMBERS (CRITICAL MISSING FEATURE)

Current Issue:
- When creating a Shared Will, the creator can set daily reminder preferences
- But members JOINING the Will have NO option to set their daily reminder preferences
- They can't choose if/when they want daily reminders for this Will
- This is a critical missing feature

Required Implementation:
- Members joining a Shared Will need ability to configure their daily reminder settings
- Suggested location: On the "Confirm Commitment" page (final step before joining)
- Add a section after the "Because" input

Questions: 1. Should daily reminders default to ON or OFF for joining members? 2. Should we suggest a default time (like creator's time, or noon)? 3. Can members change their reminder settings after joining? Where?

Please implement all  improvements: 1. Make "SHARED" status highly visible throughout 2. Add privacy note on "Confirm Commitment" page 3. Add daily reminder settings for joining members (on Confirm Commitment page) 


One more quick improvement for the "My Circles" page: CURRENT ISSUE: - Circle cards show "1 active" as the status - This is incomplete and unclear REQUIRED CHANGE: - Add the word "will" → "1 active will" - Make it dynamic based on the actual Will status EXAMPLES OF CORRECT DISPLAY: - "1 active will" (when Will is in active state) - "1 pending will" (when Will is in pending state) -DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR: - Should reflect whatever state the Will is currently in - Not just always say "active" - Pull from the actual Will status in that circle SINGULAR VS PLURAL: - "1 active will" (singular) - "2 active wills" (plural) - if somehow there are multiple (though shouldn't be possible) - Or just always use "1 [status] will" since max is one per circle Please update the circle card status text to include "will" and make it dynamic based on actual Will state!
