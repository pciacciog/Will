I‚Äôve already configured the Apple Developer environment (App ID, provisioning profiles, certificates, entitlements, etc.) in Xcode, and I‚Äôve synced the latest changes to GitHub and Replit. I‚Äôd like your help ensuring that everything on the Capacitor (Part 2) and Replit backend/server side (Part 3) is correctly set up to support this.

üì≤ PART 2: Capacitor Setup ‚Äì Please confirm the following:
Dependencies Installed:

@capacitor/core

@capacitor/cli

@capacitor/ios

@capacitor/push-notifications

Capacitor is Initialized and iOS is Added

Ensure npx cap init was run with correct app name and bundle ID.

Confirm npx cap add ios has been executed.

Capacitor Sync

Run npx cap sync ios from the Mac terminal (NOT from Replit) to reflect all changes from my latest Xcode provisioning and entitlements configuration.

iOS Project Opens and Builds Properly

Confirm that npx cap open ios launches Xcode and the project builds successfully with no missing Capacitor plugin or config issues.

üåê PART 3: Replit Server + Environment Configuration ‚Äì Please help validate:
Environment Secrets are correctly stored in Replit for APNs:

APNS_PRIVATE_KEY ‚úÖ

APNS_KEY_ID ‚úÖ

APNS_TEAM_ID ‚úÖ

APNS_TOPIC ‚úÖ (matches iOS bundle ID)

Backend Push Notification Code

Confirm the backend (e.g., pushNotificationService.ts) properly initializes the apn.Provider using these secrets.

Ensure it does not default to simulation mode due to missing or misnamed env variables.

Example block:

ts
Copy
Edit
const apnProvider = new apn.Provider({
  token: {
    key: process.env.APNS_PRIVATE_KEY,
    keyId: process.env.APNS_KEY_ID,
    teamId: process.env.APNS_TEAM_ID,
  },
  production: false,
});
Device Token Registration Endpoint

Make sure there's an API route like /api/device-token/register that:

Accepts POST requests with device token

Stores the token in the DB

Notification Sending Logic

Confirm that the server has an API (or callable function) to trigger sending a test push to a stored device token.

Ensure this code uses the proper topic (bundle ID) and is not hardcoded incorrectly.

Server Runs Without Errors

Validate the server (tsx server/index.ts) launches successfully and listens for requests.

If any issues occur with tsx or runtime, please install/fix them.

üß† Goal:
I want to confirm that everything is clean, functional, and correctly wired between Replit, Capacitor, and the iOS app. Once the setup is confirmed, I will run the app on a real iPhone and test registration and delivery end-to-end.

Thanks so much ‚Äî please let me know once you've verified each section or if you need anything from my side to move forward.
