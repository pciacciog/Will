Will App Vision: Public Wills & Explore Feature - Concept & Collaboration

THE BIG PICTURE
We're evolving how users create and discover commitments in the Will app. Right now, users have two isolated paths:
1. Solo Mode - Private accountability just for themselves
2. Circle Mode - Shared accountability with close friends
NEW VISION: What if users could make their commitments public and discoverable? Imagine someone struggling with hitting snooze finding 500 other people fighting the same battle. Or someone trying to build a daily BJJ habit connecting with others who understand that specific resistance.
The core insight: People are united by their struggles, not just their friend groups. So, Let's allow Wills themselves to become the organizing principle, not just circles.

CONCEPT: FROM CIRCLE-BOUNDED TO WILL-BOUNDED
Current Model:


User → Creates Circle → Invites Friends → Each person creates their own Wills
New Model (Additive, not replacing):


User → Creates Will → Chooses visibility (Private/Public) → Public Wills discoverable by anyone
This creates a new user journey where someone can:
* Open app
* Browse "Explore" to see what others are committing to
* Join a "No Snooze Challenge" that 200 people are already doing
* Start tracking immediately (no need to recruit friends first)
Meanwhile, Circle Mode continues to exist for the intimate accountability of close friends.

KEY ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES
1. Eliminate "Solo Mode" as a Separate Feature
Solo Mode feels like a separate silo. What if instead, every Will just has a visibility setting?
* Private Will = Old Solo Mode (just me)
* Public Will = Discoverable in Explore (anyone can join)
Question for you: Does it make sense in the current codebase to:
* Remove Solo Mode entirely and replace with a visibility flag on Wills?
* Or keep Solo Mode but add this as another option?
* What's cleanest given how things are structured?

2. Make Will Creation the Primary Action
Right now, when users open the app, what's the first thing they see? It is just to either select Circle Mode Or solo Mode. What if creating a Will was the most prominent, primary call-to-action on the home screen? Let’s do tat. 
The psychology: We want users to immediately think "What am I committing to today?" rather than navigating to find the create button.
Question for you:
* What's the best way to make "Create Will" the hero element?
* Should it be a big button at top, a floating action button, or something else?
* We should consider the secondary actions or paths like the explore and the circle flows

3. Add Visibility Choice to Will Creation Flow
Somewhere in the Will creation flow (you know it better than I do), we'd add a step where users choose:
"Who can see this Will?"
* ○ Just me (Private)
* ○ Everyone (Public - appears in Explore)
* Please note however that this should not be an option on wills that are created inside the circle mode
Considerations:
* Where in the flow does this choice make most sense?
* Should it be early (before they describe the Will) or late (after all details)?
* What should the default be? (I'm thinking Private, but open to your thoughts)

4. Create an "Explore" Experience
A new space where users can:
* Browse all public Wills
* Search for specific commitments
* See basic info: Will name, creator, how many members, duration, type
* Join any Will with a simple action
Design Questions:
* Should this be a new tab/page in the main navigation?
* How should public Wills be displayed? (Cards? List? Something else?)
* What information is most important to show on each Will?
Technical Questions:
* How should we query public Wills? (All at once? Paginated? Filtered?)
* What makes sense for search implementation given current architecture?

5. "Joining" a Public Will
When someone joins a public Will, they're essentially creating their own instance of that commitment. They track their own progress separately, but there's a connection to the "original" Will for potential future community features.
Conceptual Model:


Original Public Will (created by User A)
  ├─ Instance 1 (User B joins)
  ├─ Instance 2 (User C joins)
  └─ Instance 3 (User D joins)
Each person tracks independently, but they're all tackling the same commitment.
Questions for you:
* What's the best way to model this relationship in the current data structure?
* Should joined Wills reference the original? Or should they be independent with metadata?
* How do we count "members" on a public Will efficiently?

WHAT STAYS THE SAME
Circle Mode - Untouched
Circle Mode serves a different purpose (intimate accountability with people you know), so it should remain completely separate for now. This is additive, not a replacement.
No changes needed to:
* How Circles work
* Circle Will creation
* Circle member interactions
* Any Circle-specific features
Core Will Functionality
All the tracking, check-ins, calendars, completion flows, notifications - none of that changes. A Will works the same whether it's private, public, or in a circle.

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS (Open for Your Input)
Data Modeling Questions:
For Public Wills:
* How do we track which Will is the "original" vs. an "instance"?
* How do we efficiently count members on a public Will?
* Should we store a relationship, or just metadata?
For Visibility:
* Simple flag on Will model? (visibility: 'private' | 'public')
* Or more complex permissions system?
* What fits best with current architecture?
Query Patterns:
New queries we'll need:
* Get all public Wills (for Explore page)
* Search public Wills by keyword
* Get member count for a public Will
* Create instance when user joins
Your expertise: What's the most performant way to handle these given current database setup?
UI State Management:
Considerations:
* When user joins a Will, it should appear in their Active Wills immediately
* Explore page may need refresh/update after someone joins
* Member counts should stay reasonably current
Question: Given current state management approach, what's best way to handle these updates?

MVP SCOPE - YOUR THOUGHTS?
I'm thinking we keep the first version simple:
Include:
* Visibility setting on Will creation
* Explore page showing public Wills
* Basic join functionality
* Simple search
Exclude for now:
* Community features (chat, comments, shared feeds)
* Advanced discovery (trending, featured, categories)
* Deduplication/clustering of similar Wills
* Member lists or leaderboards
Does this scope make sense to you? What would you add or remove?

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH - SEEKING YOUR INPUT
Given that you understand the codebase structure, what's the best way to phase this?
Possible approaches:
Option A: Backend First
1. Add visibility field and public Will queries
2. Build join functionality
3. Then tackle frontend
Option B: Feature-by-Feature
1. Ship visibility setting first
2. Then Explore page
3. Then join functionality
Option C: All at Once Build everything together as one cohesive feature
What makes most sense given current architecture and development workflow?

OPEN QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
1. Default visibility: Should new Wills default to 
* Joining mechanics: When someone joins a public Will, should they be able to "unjoin" later? Or is it a commitment?
* Member visibility: Should users see WHO else has joined a public Will, or just the count?
* Search scope: Should search be simple text matching, or should we think about tags/categories eventually?
* Solo Mode removal: Should we deprecate it immediately, or migrate users gradually?
* Home screen redesign: What's the current layout, and how can we make Will creation more prominent without disrupting existing user patterns?
* 
* THE USER EXPERIENCE WE'RE AIMING FOR
* Scenario 1: Creating a Public Will
* User opens app
* Sees prominent "Create Will" action
* Goes through flow
* At some point, may choose "Make this public" “or make private”
* Will gets created and appears in their Active Wills AND in Explore (if public only)

* Scenario 2: Discovering & Joining
* User opens Explore
* Browses or searches for "no snooze"
* Finds "No Snooze Challenge" with 47 members
* Taps "Join"
* Gets confirmation/preview of commitment
* Confirms → Will instance created in their Active Wills
* They can now track independently

* Scenario 3: Still Using Private
* User creates Will
* Chooses "Just me" (private)
* Works exactly like old Solo Mode
* Never appears in Explore
* 
* COLLABORATION REQUEST
* Since you know the codebase intimately, I'm looking for your thoughts on:
* Architecture:
* Best way to model the original Will → instances relationship?
* Where does visibility fit most naturally?
* Any conflicts with existing features?
* Implementation:
* What's the cleanest path to build this?
* Any technical challenges you foresee?
* Suggested phasing/rollout approach?
* UX:
* Given current navigation, where should Explore live?
* How can we make Create Will more prominent without breaking existing flows?
* Any better ideas for the visibility choice UX?
* 
* NEXT STEPS
* Please review this concept and let me know:
* Does this make sense architecturally given current codebase structure?
* What approach would you recommend for implementing this?
* Any concerns or edge cases I haven't considered?
* Suggested modifications to make this work better with existing code?
* Time estimate for building this out?
* I'm excited to collaborate on this and trust your judgment on the technical details. Let me know what you think!
