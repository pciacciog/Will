Excellent diagnostic work! Your analysis is spot-on. Yes, please proceed with implementing all the fixes you've identified. Here's what I need:
IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
1. Fix getWillStatus() Logic (CRITICAL - Fix Issue #2)

Update getWillStatus() in both InnerCircleHub.tsx and Home.tsx
Make it trust the backend will.status field FIRST before doing any date-based calculations
Remove the client-side date logic that's overriding backend status
Implement the solution you proposed where backend status takes precedence

2. Speed Up Polling Intervals (CRITICAL - Fix Issue #1)

Update the refetchInterval logic in InnerCircleHub.tsx
Implement the intelligent polling you proposed:

5 seconds when End Room opens within 5 minutes or is already open
5 seconds when Will is ending within 5 minutes
15 seconds for waiting_for_end_room status generally
5 seconds for completed status (acknowledgments)
30 seconds default (down from 2 minutes)



3. Add End Room Status Display (IMPORTANT - Fix Issue #1 & #3)

Update UI components to check will.endRoomStatus
Show "Join End Room Now" button when endRoomStatus === 'open'
Show scheduled time when endRoomStatus === 'pending'
Ensure proper navigation after End Room completion

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
After implementing, please verify:

When a Will ends at 12:00 PM with End Room scheduled for 5:00 PM, the status shows "End Room Scheduled" (not "Will Complete")
At 5:00 PM when End Room opens, the join button appears within 5 seconds
After End Room completes, navigation goes to "Review Final Summary" (not "Create New Will")
No more status "skipping" or incorrect state displays

SAFETY CHECKS:

Make sure we're not breaking any existing functionality
Test with the staging database/environment
Verify the changes work for all will lifecycle phases:

pending → scheduled → active → waiting_for_end_room → completed



QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

Should we also add any visual indicators to show when the app is polling/refreshing data?
Do we need to update any other components beyond InnerCircleHub.tsx and Home.tsx?
Should we consider adding WebSocket support for truly real-time updates in the future, or is the improved polling sufficient?

Please proceed with the implementation and let me know if you encounter any issues or need clarification on any part of the solution.
