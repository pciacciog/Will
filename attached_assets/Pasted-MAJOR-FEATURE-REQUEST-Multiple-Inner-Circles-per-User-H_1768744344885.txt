MAJOR FEATURE REQUEST: Multiple Inner Circles per User

Hey! I need to implement a significant architectural change to allow users to be in MULTIPLE Inner Circles simultaneously. Currently, users can only be in one circle at a time, but this doesn't reflect real life - people have different groups (close friends, family, work colleagues, summer friends, etc.).

BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENT ANYTHING: Please read this entire request, analyze what needs to change, and present me with your complete implementation plan for review.

CURRENT STATE:
- Users can only be in ONE Inner Circle at a time
- When user taps "Circle Mode" from "Start Your Journey" screen, they go directly to their single Circle Hub
- Database/logic enforces this one-circle limitation

DESIRED NEW BEHAVIOR:

1. MULTIPLE CIRCLE MEMBERSHIP:
   - Users can be in MULTIPLE Inner Circles simultaneously (no limit, or maybe cap at 5-10?)
   - Each circle operates independently with its own:
     * Members (2-4 people each)
     * Active Wills
     * Circle Hub
     * History/archived Wills

2. NEW UI FLOW - "CIRCLE LOBBY":
   - When user taps "Circle Mode" from "Start Your Journey" screen
   - Instead of going directly to a Circle Hub
   - They see a "Circle Lobby" screen showing all their circles
   - User selects which circle they want to enter
   - Then they enter that specific Circle's Hub

3. CIRCLE LOBBY SCREEN SHOULD SHOW:
   - List of all circles the user is in
   - For each circle:
     * Circle name (or member names if no custom name)
     * Number of active Wills in that circle
     * Maybe preview of most recent activity?
   - Button to "Create New Circle" (generates new invite code)
   - Button to "Join Circle" (enter invite code)

4. WITHIN EACH CIRCLE HUB:
   - Everything works exactly as it does now
   - User can create Wills, see active Wills, participate, etc.
   - But it's isolated to THAT specific circle
   - Navigation should show which circle they're currently in
   - Easy way to go back to Circle Lobby

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES NEEDED:

1. DATABASE SCHEMA:
   - Remove "one circle per user" constraint
   - User-to-Circle relationship must be one-to-many (one user, many circles)
   - Ensure Wills are properly scoped to specific circles
   - Consider: Do we need a circles table with metadata?

2. INVITE CODE LOGIC:
   - When user creates a circle, they generate an invite code
   - When another user joins via that code, they're added to THAT circle
   - User can be in multiple circles via different invite codes
   - Each circle maintains its own 2-4 member limit

3. NOTIFICATIONS:
   - Push notifications need to specify WHICH circle the activity is in
   - Example: "New Will proposed in [Circle Name/Members]"
   - User needs context about which circle requires their attention

4. NAVIGATION:
   - Add "Circle Lobby" as new screen in the flow
   - Add breadcrumb or header showing current circle name
   - Easy navigation back to Circle Lobby from any Circle Hub

5. ACTIVE WILLS ACROSS CIRCLES:
   - Users can have multiple active Wills simultaneously (one per circle)
   - Each Will is scoped to its specific circle
   - Timeline/notifications work independently per circle

6. SOLO MODE:
   - Solo Mode remains separate and unaffected by circle changes
   - User can have Solo Wills + multiple Circle Wills all active

QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ANSWER IN YOUR PLAN:

1. DATABASE CHANGES:
   - What tables need to be created/modified?
   - What's the new schema for user-circle relationships?
   - How do we migrate existing single-circle users?
   - Do circles need IDs, names, or other metadata?

2. UI/UX FLOW:
   - Describe the complete navigation flow from "Circle Mode" button → Circle Lobby → Specific Circle Hub
   - How should the Circle Lobby look/function?
   - How do we display which circle the user is currently in?
   - How do users navigate between circles?

3. INVITE CODE SYSTEM:
   - Does current invite code logic need changes?
   - How do we ensure invite codes are unique per circle?
   - What happens if user tries to join a circle they're already in?

4. NOTIFICATIONS:
   - How do we scope notifications to specific circles?
   - What text/context do we add to identify which circle?
   - Any changes needed to notification triggers?

5. ACTIVE WILLS MANAGEMENT:
   - How do we track multiple active Wills across different circles?
   - Any conflicts or edge cases with multiple simultaneous Wills?
   - How does End Room scheduling work across circles?

6. MIGRATION STRATEGY:
   - How do we handle existing users who are in one circle?
   - Do they automatically keep their current circle?
   - Any data migration scripts needed?

7. EDGE CASES:
   - What if user leaves a circle? How does that work?
   - Can circles have custom names or just show member names?
   - Maximum number of circles per user?
   - What if a circle drops below 2 members?
   - Can users delete/archive circles?

8. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT:
   - How complex is this change (small/medium/large)?
   - What's your estimated effort/time?
   - Are there any technical risks or challenges?
   - Any parts that are particularly tricky?

9. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
   - Is there a simpler way to implement this?
   - Any phased approach you'd recommend?
   - Any concerns or recommendations?

DELIVERABLE:
Please provide a comprehensive implementation plan covering:
- Complete database schema changes (before/after)
- Step-by-step UI flow with new screens
- Technical architecture changes needed
- Migration strategy for existing users
- Edge case handling
- Complexity/effort assessment
- Your recommendations or concerns

DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET - I want to review and approve the plan first before any code changes.

Looking forward to your detailed plan!
