FIX 1: Main Page - Green CTA Button Formatting
Problem: Text inside the green “I Will" button is too small relative to the button size. Poor proportion/formatting.
Changes needed:
1. Increase text size inside the button to better fill the space or reducen the actual box (what makes more sense)
2. Change button text from "I will" to "Create a Will"
3. Ensure text is properly centered both horizontally and vertically

FIX 2: Remove "Check-In" from Visual Step Indicator
Current: Step indicator shows: 1 What — 2 Why — 3 When — 4 Check-In
Change to: 1 What — 2 Why — 3 When
Important:
* Only remove from visual display (the numbered step indicator at top of screen)
* Keep the actual Check-In page in the flow - users should still go through it
* Add "One final step..." loading modal after "When" page (Step 3) and before Check-In page displays
* Think of it as: Show 3 steps visually, but surprise with 4th step after brief loading moment
Flow should be:

What page (Step 1 of 3) 
  → Why page (Step 2 of 3) 
  → When page (Step 3 of 3) 
  → [Loading modal: "One final step..."] 
  → Check-In page (no step number shown) 
  → Create Will

FIX 3: Ongoing Tab - Clarify Text
Location: Timeline page, when "Ongoing" tab is selected
Current text: "You can pause or end this anytime"
Change to: "You can pause or end this Will at any time"
Why: More specific and clear that it refers to the Will, not just generic "this"

FIX 4: Ongoing Wills - Remove Confusing "End:" Field
Problem: When viewing active Ongoing Wills, it displays:

Start: Feb 9 at 6:23 AM
End:
The empty "End:" field is confusing because Ongoing Wills don't have end dates.
Solution:
For Ongoing Wills, show:

Start: Feb 9 at 6:23 AM
Type: Ongoing
OR just:

Started: Feb 9 at 6:23 AM
(Ongoing commitment)
For Set Dates Wills, keep:

Start: Feb 9 at 6:23 AM
End: Feb 15 at 11:59 PM
Logic: Only display "End:" field when timeline === 'set_dates'. For timeline === 'ongoing', either show "Type: Ongoing" or just omit the end date entirely.

Please implement these four fixes. Let me know if any part needs clarification!
