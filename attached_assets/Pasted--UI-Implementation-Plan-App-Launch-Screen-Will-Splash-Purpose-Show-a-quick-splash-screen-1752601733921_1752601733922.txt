🧱 UI Implementation Plan – App Launch Screen ("Will" Splash)
🎯 Purpose:
Show a quick splash screen that anchors the user emotionally before they reach the Welcome screen. This moment affirms the app’s tone: agency, intention, personal power.

📍 When to Display:
After Sign In/Sign Up, before navigating to the Welcome screen.

If the user is already signed in, show immediately on app open before redirecting to the Welcome screen.

Option 1: Splash Screen (Recommended)
Duration: ~2 seconds
Fade in/out effect: Optional but recommended (see Bonus)

✅ Copy:
html
Copy
Edit
<div class="h-screen w-screen bg-white flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-500 mb-2 italic tracking-wide">All You Need Is a Little...</p>
  <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-black tracking-tight">Will.</h1>
</div>
🌀 Optional Animation:
Use Framer Motion, or Tailwind animation utilities like:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="animate-fade-in transition-opacity duration-1000">
  ...
</div>
Then fade out before transitioning to the Welcome screen.

Option 2: Embedded in Onboarding (Alternate)
If not using a splash screen, integrate at the top of the first Welcome screen:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="mt-12 text-center">
  <p class="text-md text-gray-500 italic">All You Need Is a Little...</p>
  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800">Will.</h1>
</div>
✨ Bonus Touch (Optional)
Animate the word “Will.” to appear a moment after the first line.

This delay symbolizes the moment of resolve — when the user steps into their agency.

Let me know if you'd like a Figma or motion spec for it!
