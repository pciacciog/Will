Daily Tracker Improvements - 3 Changes
Context
We have two types of Wills:
1. One-time commitments - User commits once, does it, then acknowledges success
2. Daily tracker - User checks in every day during the Will period
Changes to Implement

🐛 CHANGE 1: Fix Calendar Color Update Bug
Current Bug:
* User submits check-in with "Yes, I did it!"
* Calendar date stays yellow instead of changing to green
* Colors don't update until page refresh
Expected Behavior:
* Calendar should immediately update color after check-in submission:
    * 🟢 Green = "Yes, I did it!"
    * 🟡 Yellow = "Partial success"
    * 🔴 Red = "No, I didn't"
    * ⚪ Gray/default = No check-in yet
Implementation:
* After successful check-in API call, refresh/update the calendar component state
* Ensure the date's color changes immediately without requiring page reload

✂️ CHANGE 2: Remove Note Section from Tracker Page
What to Remove:
* Delete the "note" input field from the daily check-in page
* We're keeping it simple: just Yes / Partial / No buttons
Rationale:
* The note field is redundant for quick daily tracking
* Users just need to log their status, not write explanations

🎯 CHANGE 3: Modify Final Modal for Daily Tracker Wills
Current Flow (OUTDATED):


Will ends → Step 1: "Did you follow through?" modal → Show results
New Flow for Daily Tracker Wills:
When Will ends:
1. Show summary screen with all check-ins:


Challenge Results

[Calendar showing all check-ins based on however amount of days the will was selected for]
✅ ✅ ❌ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌

Success Rate: 5/7 days (71%)

[Button: "Looks good! Finalize Results"]
[Link: "Make adjustments" - allows editing check-ins]
1. User clicks "Looks good! Finalize Results"
2. Show final results page:


Challenge Complete! ✅

You completed 5 out of 7 days (71%)

[Show to circle / Share results]
Implementation Notes:
* Skip the Step 1 acknowledgment modal entirely for daily tracker Wills
* User has already been tracking daily - no need to ask "did you do it?"
* Allow user to review/edit final tally before finalizing
* After confirmation, display final results to user and circle members
Keep Step 1 Modal for One-Time Commitments:
* One-time Wills still need the "Did you follow through?" acknowledgment
* This change only applies to daily tracker type Wills

Logic Summary:
Will Type	Has Step 1 Modal?	Rationale
One-time commitment	✅ Yes	User needs to report: "Did I do it?"
Daily tracker	❌ No	Already tracked daily - just confirm final results
Testing Checklist:
After implementation, verify:
* Calendar colors update immediately after check-in
* Green = Yes, Yellow = Partial, Red = No, Gray = Not checked in
* Note field removed from tracker page
* Daily tracker Wills skip Step 1 modal when ending
* Summary screen shows all check-ins with edit option
* User can finalize results after review
* One-time commitment Wills still show Step 1 modal (unchanged)
