Hi Repl AI Agent,

I want to explore a new feature idea for the Will app and get your architectural perspective on how it would fit into our current system.

CONCEPT: "Cumulative Will" (Team Commitment Mode)

Currently, our Circle mode works like this:
- One person creates a Will with shared timeline (start/end dates)
- They invite Inner Circle members
- Each member defines THEIR OWN individual commitment ("what")
- Everyone works on different goals but within the same timeframe
- Example: Sarah meditates, John exercises, Teo avoids social media - all during the same week

NEW IDEA: Add a "Cumulative" variant where:
- One person creates a Will with shared timeline (same as now)
- BUT they also define a SINGLE commitment that EVERYONE does together
- Members receive invite with the commitment already defined
- Members can only Accept/Decline (not customize the "what")
- Example: "We all commit to: No phones after 8pm on Saturday"

REAL-WORLD USE CASES:
- Group digital detox challenges
- Team fitness challenges (everyone does same workout)
- Collective fasting or dietary commitments
- Study groups committing to same study schedule

MY QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

1. **Architecture & Data Model:**
   - How would you recommend structuring this in our existing schema?
   - Do you see this as a new `mode` (solo/circle/cumulative) or a flag on circle mode?
   - What changes to the `wills` and `will_commitments` tables make sense?
   - Should we store the shared commitment at the Will level or commitment level?

2. **Flow Path Analysis:**
   - Walk me through what changes in the current flow
   - What can stay EXACTLY the same vs what needs modification?
   - How does Will creation change?
   - How does the invitation/acceptance flow change?
   - How does Will Details display change?

3. **User Experience:**
   - Should invited members be able to add their personal "why" even though "what" is fixed?
   - What happens if the creator wants to edit the commitment after sending invites?
   - How do we visually distinguish cumulative vs classic Wills?
   - Are midpoint check-ins and End Room different for cumulative?

4. **Edge Cases & Considerations:**
   - What if someone wants to decline a cumulative Will?
   - Can members see who accepted/declined before committing?
   - Should notifications be different for cumulative ("Team is 80% complete!")?
   - Any potential issues with existing code that assumes individual commitments?

5. **Implementation Complexity:**
   - What's your assessment of how complex this would be to implement?
   - What are the biggest architectural challenges?
   - What's the minimum viable version vs full-featured version?
   - Any potential breaking changes to existing functionality?

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:
Please provide a detailed proposal that includes:
- Your recommended data model changes
- Flow diagrams or descriptions of what changes where
- What stays the same vs what needs refactoring
- Potential gotchas or challenges you foresee
- Phased implementation approach (if applicable)
- Your creative ideas on how to make this feature shine

Don't implement anything yet - I want to understand the full scope and your architectural thinking first before we proceed.

Take your time and be thorough! I value your perspective on how this fits into our existing system.
