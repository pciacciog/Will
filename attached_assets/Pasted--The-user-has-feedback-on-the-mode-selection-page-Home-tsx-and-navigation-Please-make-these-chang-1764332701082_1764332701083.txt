"The user has feedback on the mode selection page (Home.tsx) and navigation. Please make these changes:

Changes to Home.tsx (Mode Selection Page):
1. Reorder the Cards - Inner Circle First
Currently: Solo Mode → Inner Circle
Change to: Inner Circle → Solo Mode
Inner Circle should be the primary/default option, so it appears first.
2. Change Header Text
Current: "How would you like to grow?"
Change to: "Start Your Journey" (or similar text that matches the original style)
The goal is to revert closer to the original Home.tsx design that said "Start your journey" before showing the options.
3. Remove Bottom Text
Remove: "You can switch between modes anytime" text at the bottom
This text is unnecessary clutter.
4. Overall Style
The page should feel more like the original journey start screen, but with two path options instead of one. Keep the cards nice and clean, but less explanation text overall.

Add Back Button to Inner Circle Hub:
File: client/src/pages/InnerCircleHub.tsx
Add a back/home button in the header that navigates back to / (the mode selection page).
Suggested placement: Top-left corner (where back buttons typically are)
Icon: Home icon or Back arrow
Behavior: Clicking it should navigate to / so users can switch between modes
Example:
tsximport { Home, ArrowLeft } from "lucide-react";

// In the header section:
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <Button
    variant="ghost"
    size="icon"
    onClick={() => setLocation('/')}
  >
    <ArrowLeft className="h-5 w-5" />
  </Button>
  
  <h1>Inner Circle Hub</h1>
  
  <SettingsButton />
</div>

Summary of Changes:

✅ Inner Circle card appears FIRST (before Solo Mode)
✅ Header text: "Start Your Journey" (not "How would you like to grow?")
✅ Remove "You can switch between modes anytime" footer text
✅ Add back button to InnerCircleHub.tsx header (navigates to /)
✅ Keep the overall design clean and similar to original style

Please implement these changes and show me the updated Home.tsx and InnerCircleHub.tsx."
