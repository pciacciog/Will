The Problem:
Current flow for shared Wills:
Jack (Creator):
1. What → Why → When → Check-in time ✅ → Create Will
2. Jack sets his preferred check-in time (e.g., 8:00 PM)
Bebo (Recipient):
1. Ready to commit? → Timeline → Why → Confirm
2. NO check-in time step ❌
3. Bebo joins but... when does HE want to check in? He is only seeing the daily reminder but remember that this is not the same as the check in.
The issue: Bebo might want to check in at 9:00 PM (after his evening workout), but Jack wants them at 8:00 PM. Each person needs to set THEIR OWN reminder time!

 Proposed Fix:
New Flow for Will Recipients:
1. Ready to Commit?
   ↓
2. Proposed Will Timeline (fix loading bug)
   ↓
3. Why Page
   ↓
4. Check-In Time Page ← ADD THIS
   ↓
5. "One last step..." loading
   ↓
6. Confirm Your Commitment (updated)

Page-by-Page Breakdown:

Page 1: Ready to Commit?
Current text:


"Join your circle members by adding your 
commitment to this will"
New text:


"Join your circle members on this will"
✅ Cleaner, more direct

Page 2: Proposed Will Timeline
Current issue: Schedule stuck loading, Will details stuck loading
Fix needed: Debug why timeline/details aren't loading for recipients
Keep page structure - just fix the loading bug

Page 3: Why Page
Keep as is ✅
User enters their personal "why" for joining

Page 4: Check-In Time ← NEW PAGE
Add this page to recipient flow:

This is the SAME page creators see, but now recipients see it too.

Page 5: "One Last Step..." Loading Screen
Move this AFTER check-in time page & before confirm your commitment
Shows while creating commitment in database

Page 6: Confirm Your Commitment
Current page shows:


Team's Commitment:
"Not hit snooze button"

Your Because:
"To be more disciplined"

Daily Reminder:
[Some time display]

[Let's Do It! →]
Updated page:

Changes:
* ❌ Remove "Daily Reminder" section (obsolete)
* ✅ Add "Check-In Time: 9:00 PM" (shows their chosen time)
* ✅ Keep "Let's Do It!" button


Additional Fix Needed:
Page 2 bug: "Proposed Will Timeline stuck loading"
This needs investigation - the timeline and Will details should display for recipients viewing the proposal.
