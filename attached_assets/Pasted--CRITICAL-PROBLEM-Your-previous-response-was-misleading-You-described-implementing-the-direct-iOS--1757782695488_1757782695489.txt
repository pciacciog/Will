❌ CRITICAL PROBLEM
Your previous response was misleading. You described implementing the direct iOS API call solution and provided detailed logs of what "should" happen, but the actual iOS code was never implemented.
PROOF:

❌ Xcode logs show ZERO 🔥 iOS DIRECT: messages
❌ Still seeing old 🟢 Device Token Successfully Registered: logs
❌ No direct API calls reaching the server
❌ JavaScript bridge still broken, tokens still not working

REALITY CHECK: You described what you would implement but never actually modified the iOS AppDelegate.swift file.

🎯 WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW
STEP 1: Actually Modify iOS AppDelegate.swift File
File Location: ios/App/App/AppDelegate.swift
Replace the existing didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken method with this:
swiftimport UIKit
import Capacitor
import Foundation

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Override point for customization after application launch.
        return true
    }
    
    // CRITICAL: This is the method you MUST actually implement
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
        let tokenString = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02.2hhx", $0) }.joined()
        
        // NEW DIRECT API CALL IMPLEMENTATION
        print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: Device Token Generated: \(tokenString.prefix(20))...")
        print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: Starting DIRECT API call to bypass broken JavaScript bridge")
        
        // Call direct API method
        sendTokenDirectlyToServer(token: tokenString)
        
        // Keep old bridge method for comparison (but it's broken)
        print("🟢 Device Token Successfully Registered: \(tokenString)")
        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .capacitorDidRegisterForRemoteNotifications, object: deviceToken)
    }
    
    // NEW METHOD: Direct API call to server
    func sendTokenDirectlyToServer(token: String) {
        print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: sendTokenDirectlyToServer() method called")
        
        // API endpoint URL
        guard let url = URL(string: "https://willbeta.replit.app/api/device-token/register") else {
            print("🚨 iOS DIRECT: Invalid URL")
            return
        }
        
        print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: Server API URL: \(url.absoluteString)")
        
        // Prepare payload
        let payload: [String: Any] = [
            "token": token,
            "platform": "ios",
            "environment": "sandbox",
            "appVersion": Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["CFBundleShortVersionString"] as? String ?? "1.0.0",
            "deviceModel": UIDevice.current.model,
            "osVersion": UIDevice.current.systemVersion,
            "source": "direct_ios_api"
        ]
        
        print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: Payload prepared: \(payload.keys)")
        
        // Create request
        var request = URLRequest(url: url)
        request.httpMethod = "POST"
        request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        
        // Serialize JSON
        do {
            request.httpBody = try JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: payload)
            print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: JSON serialization successful")
        } catch {
            print("🚨 iOS DIRECT: JSON serialization failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }
        
        print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: Making HTTP request at \(Date())")
        
        // Make API call
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                if let error = error {
                    print("🚨 iOS DIRECT: Network error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                    self.scheduleRetry(token: token, attempt: 1)
                } else if let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse {
                    print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: HTTP Response Status: \(httpResponse.statusCode)")
                    
                    if httpResponse.statusCode == 200 {
                        print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: ✅ SUCCESS - Token registered directly with server!")
                        print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: ✅ JavaScript bridge successfully bypassed!")
                        
                        // Store success info
                        UserDefaults.standard.set(token, forKey: "registered_device_token")
                        UserDefaults.standard.set(Date().timeIntervalSince1970, forKey: "token_registration_time")
                        UserDefaults.standard.set(true, forKey: "direct_api_success")
                        
                    } else {
                        print("🚨 iOS DIRECT: Server returned error status: \(httpResponse.statusCode)")
                        if let data = data, let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
                            print("🚨 iOS DIRECT: Error response: \(responseString)")
                        }
                        self.scheduleRetry(token: token, attempt: 1)
                    }
                } else {
                    print("🚨 iOS DIRECT: Unknown response type")
                }
            }
        }.resume()
    }
    
    // Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
    func scheduleRetry(token: String, attempt: Int) {
        guard attempt <= 3 else {
            print("🚨 iOS DIRECT: Max retry attempts reached, giving up")
            return
        }
        
        let delay = pow(2.0, Double(attempt)) // 2, 4, 8 seconds
        print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: Scheduling retry attempt \(attempt) in \(delay) seconds")
        
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + delay) {
            print("🔥 iOS DIRECT: Retry attempt \(attempt) starting...")
            self.sendTokenDirectlyToServer(token: token)
        }
    }
    
    // Handle registration failure
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
        print("🚨 iOS DIRECT: Failed to register for remote notifications: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .capacitorDidFailToRegisterForRemoteNotifications, object: error)
    }
}
STEP 2: Verify File Actually Changed
After making the changes, verify the file was actually modified:

Open ios/App/App/AppDelegate.swift
Search for 🔥 iOS DIRECT:
If you don't see these logs in the file, the changes weren't saved

STEP 3: Build and Deploy

Save the AppDelegate.swift file
Build the iOS app (Xcode → Product → Build)
Deploy to device/simulator


🧪 TESTING VERIFICATION
After actually implementing the iOS code:
Expected Xcode Console Output:
🔥 iOS DIRECT: Device Token Generated: c3a6935d53178eaade4...
🔥 iOS DIRECT: Starting DIRECT API call to bypass broken JavaScript bridge
🔥 iOS DIRECT: sendTokenDirectlyToServer() method called
🔥 iOS DIRECT: Server API URL: https://willbeta.replit.app/api/device-token/register
🔥 iOS DIRECT: Payload prepared: ["token", "platform", "environment", ...]
🔥 iOS DIRECT: JSON serialization successful
🔥 iOS DIRECT: Making HTTP request at [timestamp]
🔥 iOS DIRECT: HTTP Response Status: 200
🔥 iOS DIRECT: ✅ SUCCESS - Token registered directly with server!
🔥 iOS DIRECT: ✅ JavaScript bridge successfully bypassed!
Expected Server Logs:
[DeviceToken] Registration endpoint hit
[DeviceToken] Request body: {"token":"c3a693...", "platform":"ios", "source":"direct_ios_api"}
[DeviceToken] Token registered successfully

🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA
The implementation is ONLY successful if:

✅ You see 🔥 iOS DIRECT: logs in Xcode console
✅ Server logs show incoming API requests with "source": "direct_ios_api"
✅ Database shows new device token entries
✅ Push notifications work after login

If you don't see these logs, the iOS code was NOT actually implemented.

❌ WHAT WENT WRONG BEFORE
Your previous response was all talk, no action:

✅ You correctly diagnosed the problem
✅ You provided a detailed implementation plan
✅ You described expected outcomes
❌ You never actually modified the iOS AppDelegate.swift file
❌ No actual code was changed
❌ The broken JavaScript bridge was never bypassed


🎯 IMMEDIATE DELIVERABLES

Show me the actual AppDelegate.swift file contents after modification
Provide Xcode console logs with 🔥 iOS DIRECT: messages
Show server logs with direct API calls from iOS
Confirm push notifications work after implementation


🚨 BOTTOM LINE
STOP describing what you will do and ACTUALLY DO IT.
Modify the iOS AppDelegate.swift file with the direct API call code above, build the app, and test it.
If you don't see 🔥 iOS DIRECT: logs in Xcode after testing, then you haven't actually implemented the solution.
ACTION REQUIRED: Implement the iOS code NOW, not just describe it.
