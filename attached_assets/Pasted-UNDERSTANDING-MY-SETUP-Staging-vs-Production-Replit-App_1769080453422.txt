UNDERSTANDING MY SETUP: Staging vs Production Replit Apps

Hey! I want to make sure you understand my current setup so you can help me deploy properly.

MY CONFIGURATION:

I have TWO completely separate Replit apps (see attached screenshot):

**App 1: "Will (STAGING)"**
- Last updated: 5 minutes ago (actively working here)
- Bundle ID: `com.porfirio.will.staging`
- URL: https://will-staging-porfirioaciacci.replit.app
- Database: Staging database (separate from production)
- Purpose: Testing and development

**App 2: "Will (PRODUCTION)"**
- Last updated: 1 month ago (haven't touched it recently)
- Bundle ID: `com.porfirio.will`
- URL: https://will-1-porfirioaciacci.replit.app
- Database: Production database (separate from staging)
- Purpose: Live app for real users

WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING:

For the past month, I've been actively developing in the STAGING app:
- Fixed the history feature
- Added authentication improvements
- Fixed iOS-specific bugs
- Made many other updates

All of this work has been committed to our shared GitHub repository.

THE PRODUCTION APP:
- Has been untouched for 1 month
- Is running old code from a month ago
- Needs to be updated with all the recent staging work
- Has its own production database (which is correct - I want to keep staging and production databases separate)

MY QUESTION:

Given this setup, can you help me understand what I need to do NOW in the Production Replit app to carry over all the work I've been doing in Staging?

I'm guessing I need to:
1. Pull the latest code from GitHub?
2. Update environment variables?
3. Run database migrations?
4. Something else?

But I want to make sure I do this correctly and don't miss anything. Can you walk me through the specific steps I should take in the Production app to get it up to date with all my recent Staging work?

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:

- Both apps use the SAME GitHub repository for code
- They have DIFFERENT databases (this is intentional)
- They have DIFFERENT URLs (this is handled by bundle ID detection in the code)
- The code changes from staging are already in GitHub
- I just need to update the Production Replit app to use the latest code

What do I need to do in the Production app now? Please guide me through this step by step. 🙏
